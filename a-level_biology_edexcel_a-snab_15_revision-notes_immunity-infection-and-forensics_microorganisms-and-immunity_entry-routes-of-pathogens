ways in which pathogens can enter</p><ul><li><p><b>Broken skin</b></p><ul><li><p>This provides direct access to the tissues and bloodstream</p></li></ul></li><li><p>The <b>digestive system</b></p><ul><li><p>When we consume contaminated food and drink</p></li></ul></li><li><p>The <b>respiratory system</b></p><ul><li><p>Every time we inhale</p></li></ul></li><li><p><b>Mucosal surfaces</b></p><ul><li><p>The lining of body cavities e.g. inside of nose, mouth, genitals</p></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h4 id="barriers-to-infection">Barriers to infection</h4><ul><li><p>Skin</p><ul><li><p>This provides a <b>physical barrier</b> against infection</p></li><li><p>If the skin is damaged it leaves the exposed tissue beneath vulnerable to pathogens</p></li><li><p>The <b>blood clotting mechanism</b> of the body plays an important role in preventing pathogen entry in the case of damage to the skin</p></li><li><p>Blood clotting takes time, however, so a few pathogens may still enter before a clot forms</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Microorganisms of the gut and skin</p><ul><li><p>Collectively these <b>harmless</b> microorganisms are known as the <b>gut </b>or <b>skin</b> <b>flora</b></p></li><li><p>They <b>compete</b> with pathogens for resources, thereby <b>limiting</b> their numbers and therefore their ability to infect the body</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Stomach acid</p><ul><li><p>The <b>hydrochloric acid</b> that makes up a large part of the gastric juices in the stomach creates an <b>acidic environment</b> that is <b>unfavourable </b>to many pathogens present on food and drink</p></li><li><p>Sometimes a few of these pathogens may survive and make their way to the intestines where they infect the gut wall cells and cause disease</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Lysozyme</p><ul><li><p>Secretions of the <b>mucosal surfaces, </b>e.g. tears, saliva, and mucus, contains an enzyme called <b>lysozyme</b></p></li><li><p>This enzyme will <b>damage bacterial cell walls</b>, causing them to burst, or lyse</p></li></ul></li></ul><div class="mb-5" data-type="image"><img alt="Chemical and
