could be<b> extremely serious</b> for humans and global biodiversity<b> if we continue </b>with current human activities</p></li><li><p>If we want to limit the consequences of global warming it is essential that we act quickly to <b>reduce carbon emissions</b> and <b>increase the rate at which carbon is removed from the atmosphere</b></p></li><li><p>Our knowledge of the carbon cycle tells us that we can do these things in several ways</p></li></ul><h4 id="reducing-carbon-emissions">Reducing carbon emissions</h4><ul><li><p>Carbon emissions can be reduced by <b>limiting the rate at which fossil fuels are burned</b></p><ul><li><p>This is challenging as so many of our <b>daily activities depend on the burning of fossil fuels </b>to release energy</p><ul><li><p>Transport of people and goods</p></li><li><p>Electricity generation</p></li><li><p>Food production</p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p>Two current ways of reducing carbon emissions are</p><ul><li><p>Burning biofuels instead of fossil fuels</p></li><li><p>The use of other renewable energy resources</p></li></ul></li></ul><h4 id="biofuels">Biofuels</h4><ul><li><p>These fuels are made from <b>recently living plant biomass</b> such as sugar cane</p></li><li><p>Biofuels can be burned in the same way as fossil fuels, <b>releasing carbon dioxide</b> as they burn</p></li><li><p>Arguments in support of biofuel use include </p><ul><li><p>Biofuels are often cheaper than oil</p></li><li><p>It is argued that biofuels are <b>'carbon neutral'</b> meaning that they only release carbon that was recently removed from the atmosphere when the plants were alive</p><ul><li><p>They do not release carbon that has been stored away for millions of years as with fossil fuels</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Biofuels are a <b>renewable</b> source of energy, i.e. they can be regrown quickly </p></li></ul></li><li><p>There are several arguments against the use of biofuels</p><ul><li><p>They do still release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere</p></li><li><p>The vast amounts of land required to grow biofuels <b>could otherwise have been used for food production</b></p></li><li><p>Creating land for biofuel growth often involves the loss of other types of habitats e.g. rainforest; this is <b>bad for biodiversity</b></p></li><li><p>Cutting down mature trees to create land for biofuel growth <b>reduces the removal of carbon from the atmosphere by photosynthesis</b></p></li></ul></li></ul><h4 id="other-renewable-sources">Other renewable sources</h4><ul><li><p>For example wind, solar, geothermal, and tidal

</b>to use</p></li><li><p><b>No carbon dioxide is released</b> when these technologies are used to generate electricity</p></li></ul></li><li><p>The current disadvantage of such renewable resources is that <b>no single source is perfect </b>e.g.</p><ul><li><p>Geothermal energy can only be used when there is volcanic activity close to the earth's surface</p></li><li><p>Solar energy depends on sunshine hours</p></li><li><p>Wind energy depends on wind speeds and some conservationists are concerned about the impact of wind turbines on birds and bats</p><ul><li><p>Some are also concerned about the visual impact of wind turbines on the landscape</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Tidal energy can only be generated near the coast</p></li></ul></li></ul><p class="text-center"><b>Comparing Energy
