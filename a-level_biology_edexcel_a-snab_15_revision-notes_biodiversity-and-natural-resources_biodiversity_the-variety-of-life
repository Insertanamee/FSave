that have more than one form (allele) and how many possible alleles each gene has</p></li><li><p>There can be genetic differences or diversity <b>between populations</b> of the same species</p><ul><li><p>These differences may arise because the two populations occupy slightly different ranges in their habitat and so are subject to slightly different selection pressures that affect the allele frequencies in their populations</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Genetic diversity can also be observed <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>single population</b></p><ul><li><p>Genetic diversity in a species is important as it can help the population <b>adapt</b> to, and survive, <b>changes in the environment</b></p></li><li><p>The changes could be in <b>biotic factors</b> such as new predators, pathogens and competition with other species</p></li><li><p>Or the changes could be through <b>abiotic factors</b> like temperature, humidity and rainfall</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Genetic diversity is <b>limited</b> in populations that are very <b>small</b> or <b>isolated</b></p><ul><li><p><b>Inbreeding</b> in small, isolated populations leads to a <b>high proportion</b> of individuals being <b>homozygous</b> (e.g. AA to aa) for many genes, resulting in <b>lower genetic diversity</b></p></li><li><p>This can mean that <b>genetic diseases</b> caused by <b>recessive alleles</b> can
