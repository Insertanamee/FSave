warming and climate change are terms that are often used interchangeably, but in fact they have slightly different meanings:</p><ul><li><p><b>Global warming</b> refers to the rise in global temperatures mainly due to the increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.</p></li><li><p><b>Climate change</b> refers to the increasing changes in the measures of climate over a long period of time – including precipitation, temperature, and wind patterns. These are often a consequence of global warming.</p></li><li><p><b>The greenhouse effect</b> is a naturally occurring event, constantly occurring due to the atmosphere and sunlight.</p></li></ul></div></div></div></div>
