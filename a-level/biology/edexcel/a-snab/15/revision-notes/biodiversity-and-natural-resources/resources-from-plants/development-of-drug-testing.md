## Development of Drug Testing

* Whenever new drugs are developed, they first need to be **tested** for effectiveness and side-effects, before they can be sold to the general public
* These are known as **clinical trials** and are crucial to avoid exposing the public to drugs that may pose a risk to their health
* Drug testing has not always been this scientific or regulated in the past

#### Digitalis soup

* **William Withering** was an English scientist from the 1700s
* He is best known for his work on using **digitalis** as a treatment for swelling caused by heart failure (known as **dropsy**)
* Withering treated his patients with an extract made from **foxgloves**, which contains the drug **digitalis**
* Foxglove is **poisonous to humans**, so he made different versions of his remedy containing **different concentrations** of digitalis
* These versions were called his **digitalis soup**
* He experimented on his patients to find the **most effective concentration** of digitalis that would treat dropsy without poisoning the patient

#### Modern methods of drug testing

* Modern drug testing protocols are much more rigorous than those of the past
* The first step is **modelling** the potential effects of the drug using **computers**
* Next, the drug will be tested on **human tissues** in a laboratory, before being tested on **animals**
* Should the drug pass these steps without causing any major problems, then it will continue on to the **clinical trial** stage where human test subjects will take it
* There are three phases of testing during clinical trials:

  + **Phase 1** involves a small group of healthy individuals to determine how the body will react to the drug, side effects of the drug and the correct dosage that should be taken
  + **Phase 2** will be done on a larger group of patients (non-healthy individuals who require the drug) to determine the effectiveness of the drug
  + **Phase 3** involves comparing the drug to existing drugs to see if it works any better. A large number of patients are split into two groups, each of which receives either the new drug or the existing one

#### Placebos

* **Placebos** are typically done during phase 2 of a clinical trial
* Patients are split into two groups - one will receive the drug and the other group will be given a placebo, which **looks exactly like the drug** but contains **no active ingredients**

  + The patients are **not told** which group they are in
* This provides a way for scientists to determine whether the drug actually **works**
* Certain patients display what is known as the **placebo effect**

  + This is where a patient will show improvements in their health due to the **belief** that they are receiving the drug

#### Double blind studies

* These happen during phase 2 and 3 of clinical trials
* Double blind means that **neither the patient nor the doctor** knows which patient is receiving the drug or the placebo
* This reduces the effect that the attitude of either doctor or patient may have on the results

  + For example, in some cases, a doctor may believe a patient is improving more if they know the patient is receiving the drug
