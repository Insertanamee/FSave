## Sustainability & Plant Materials

* **Sustainability** refers to the using resources in such a way that the requirements of the **current generation** are met **without depleting** these resources for future generations
* This requires the use of **renewable resources** - which can be used without the resource running out

  + An example would be **solar energy** - it will not run out in our lifetime as the sun will continue to shine every day for several billion more years
* **Fossil fuels** are an example of a **non-renewable** resource, as they could potentially run out if we use them too fast (since it takes millions of years for fossil fuels to form)
* **Sustainable practices** are those that minimise the damage done to the environment and its resources, to ensure that there will be something left for the next generation

  + An example would be **replanting trees** after logging
* **Unsustainable practices** are limited by a finite supply of resources

  + An example is the use of fossil fuels to make **oil-based plastics**

#### Plant fibres and Sustainability

* Using **plant fibres** to make products such as ropes and fabric is **more sustainable** than using oil-based plastics
* **Less fossil fuels** are used and plants can be **replanted** for the next generation
* Plant fibres are **biodegradable**, unlike most oil-based plastics, which means the products made from these fibres can be **broken down by microbes** to minimise environmental pollution
* Extracting and processing oil is an expensive and difficult procedure compared to growing and processing plants, making plant-based products **easier** and **cheaper** to produce in developing countries
* However, the ropes made from plant fibres are typically not as strong as plastic ones

#### Starch and Sustainability

* Plants store excess sugars as **starch** in their cells
* Starch can be used to make **bioplastics** which is **more sustainable** than making oil-based plastics
* It does **not require as much fossil fuels** to be burned to produce them and the crop plants can be **replanted** (renewable resource)
* Starch can also be used to make **bioethanol**, which can be used as a fuel for vehicles
* Using starch to produce biofuels is **more sustainable** than producing them from oil
