## Natural Selection can lead to Adaptation & Evolution

* **Variation**exists within a species population

  + Variation refers to the **differences between individuals**. It can be interspecific (between different species) or intraspecific variation (between individuals of the same species)
* Some of this variation is due to **random mutations**, which introduce new alleles into a population
* This means that some individuals within the population possess **different phenotypes** due to genetic variation in the alleles they possess
* Environmental factors affect the chance of survival of an organism; they are said to act as a **selection pressure**

  + **Predation**, **disease** and **competition** are all examples of selection pressures, which make it difficult for all individuals in a population to survive
* Selection pressures **increase** **the** **chance** of individuals with a **specific phenotype**surviving and reproducing over others

  + The **advantageous alleles** that code for the favourable phenotype will be passed on to offspring
* When selection pressures act over several generations of a species, they have an effect on the**frequency of alleles** in a population through **natural selection**

  + Natural selection is the process by which individuals with a favourable phenotype are more likely to survive and pass on their alleles to their offspring so that the **advantageous alleles increase in frequency over time and generations**
* Individuals that do not possess the advantageous alleles will most likely **not survive** long enough to reproduce, therefore **reducing competition** for resources

  + This will decrease the frequency of these non-advantageous alleles over time in a population
* These changes in allele frequency will ultimately lead to **evolution** within the population

#### Evidence for evolution by natural selection

* The theory of evolution by natural selection was first suggested by **Charles Darwin**

  + As **evidence** mounted in favour of this theory, it became increasingly accepted by scientists
  + In science, evidence provides **confidence** in theories until the point where enough evidence is gathered in order to accept the theory as an accepted **scientific explanation**
* The **peppered moth** is an example of how natural selection leads to evolution over time
