## Reproductive Isolation

* Organisms that belong to the **same** **species** share the **same characteristics** and are able to produce **fertile offspring**
* Reproductive isolation occurs when changes in the **alleles** and **phenotypes** of some individuals in a population **prevent** them from successfully **breeding** with other individuals in the population that don't have these changed alleles or phenotypes
* Examples of allele or phenotype changes that can lead to reproductive isolation include:

  + **Seasonal** **changes** - some individuals in a population may develop different **mating** or **flowering** seasons (becoming sexually active at different times of the year) to the rest of the population (i.e their **reproductive timings** no longer match up)
  + **Mechanical changes** - some individuals in a population may develop changes in their **genitalia** that prevent them from **mating** successfully with individuals of the opposite sex (i.e. their **reproductive body parts** no longer match up)
  + **Behavioural changes** - some individuals in a population may develop changes in their **courtship behaviours**, meaning they can no longer **attract** individuals of the opposite sex for **mating** (i.e. their methods of attracting a mate are no longer effective)
* These changes could be brought about due to **geographical barriers** isolating populations or **random mutations** producing new, different alleles in a population

#### Speciation

* Speciation can occur when populations of a species become **separated** from each other by **geographical** **barriers**

  + The barrier could be **natural** like a body of water, or a mountain range
  + It can also be **man-made**, like a motorway
* This creates two populations of the same species who are **geographically isolated** from each other, and as a result, **no gene exchange**can occur between them
* If there are sufficient **selection pressures**acting to change the **gene pools** (and allele frequencies) within both populations then eventually these populations will**diverge**and form**separate species**

  + The changes in the alleles/genes of each population will affect the **phenotypes** present in both populations
  + **Random mutations** within each population will also change allele frequencies in each
  + Over time, the two populations may begin to **differ** physiologically, behaviourally and anatomically (structurally)

#### Examiner Tips and Tricks

Remember that speciation takes a very long time to occur. Enough genetic differences between the populations need to accumulate to reproductively isolate them from one another.
