## Hardy-Weinberg Equation

#### Hardy-Weinberg Principle

* The Hardy-Weinberg principle states that if certain conditions are met, the**allele frequencies of a gene within a population will not change from one generation to the next**
* There are several **conditions or assumptions**that must be met for the Hardy-Weinberg principle to hold true:

  + **Mating** must be **random** between individuals
  + The population is **infinitely large**
  + There is **no migration, mutation** or **natural selection**
* The Hardy-Weinberg **equation** allows for the**calculation of allele and genotype frequencies**within populations
* It also allows for predictions to be made about how these frequencies will change in future generations
* If the allele frequencies in a population **change over time**, then it means that migration, mutation or natural selection has happened

#### Hardy-Weinberg calculations

* If the phenotype of a trait in a population is determined by a single gene with only two alleles (we will use **B / b**as examples throughout this section**)**, then the population will consist of individuals with three possible genotypes:

  + **Homozygous** dominant (**BB**)
  + **Heterozygous**(**Bb**)
  + Homozygous recessive (**bb**)
* When using the Hardy-Weinberg equation, the **frequency of a genotype** is represented as a **proportion** of the population

  + For example, the **BB** genotype could be 0.40
  + Whole population = 1
  + The letter ***p*** represents the frequency of the dominant allele (**B**)
  + The letter ***q*** represents the frequency of the recessive allele (**b**)
  + As there are only two alleles at a single gene locus for this phenotypic trait in the population:

***p + q*****= 1**

* The chance of an individual being homozygous dominant is ***p*****2**

  + In this instance, the offspring would inherit dominant alleles from both parents ( ***p***x***p***=***p*****2***)*
* The chance of an individual being heterozygous is **2*****pq***

  + Offspring could inherit a dominant allele from the father and a recessive allele from the mother (***p*** x ***q*** ) **or**offspring could inherit a dominant allele from the mother and a recessive allele from the father (***p*** x ***q*** ) = **2*****pq***
* The chance of an individual being homozygous recessive is***q*****2**

  + In this instance, the offspring would inherit recessive alleles from both parents ( ***q***x***q***=***q*****2***)*
* As these are all the possible genotypes of individuals in the population, the following equation can be constructed:

***p*****2****+*****q*****2****+ 2*****pq*****= 1**

#### Worked Example

In a population of birds, 10% of the individuals exhibit the recessive phenotype of white feathers. Calculate the frequencies of all genotypes.

**Answer:**

* We will use **F / f** to represent dominant and recessive alleles for feather colour

  + Those with the recessive phenotype must have the homozygous recessive genotype, **ff**
  + Therefore***q*****2****= 0.10** (as 10% of the individuals have the recessive phenotype and ***q*****2**represents this)

To calculate the frequencies of the homozygous dominant ( ***p*****2** ) and heterozygous ( **2*****pq*** ):

**Step 1: Find q**

![Natural Selection Hardy-Weinberg Principle Worked Example equation](5.-Natural-Selection-Hardy-Weinberg-Principle-Worked-Example-equation.png)

**Step 2: Find*****p*****(the frequency of the dominant allele F). If q = 0.32, and p + q = 1**

***p****+****q*** = 1

***p*** = 1 - 0.32

***p***= 0.68

**Step 3: Find*****p*****2****(the frequency of homozygous dominant genotype)**

0.682= 0.46

***p*****2** = 0.46

**Step 4: Find 2*****pq =*****2 x (p) x (q)**

2 x (0.68) x (0.32)

= 0.44

**Step 5: Check calculations by substituting the values for the three frequencies into the equation; they should add up to 1**

***p*****2** + **2*****pq*** + ***q*****2** = 1

0.46 + 0.44 + 0.10 = 1

**In summary:**

* Allele frequencies:

  + *p*= **F** = 0.68
  + *q* =**f**= 0.32
  + Genotype frequencies:

    - *p*2 = **FF** = 0.46
    - *q*2 = **ff**= 0.10
    - 2*pq* = **Ff**= 0.44

#### Examiner Tips and Tricks

When you are using Hardy-Weinberg equations, start your calculations by determining the proportion of individuals that display the **recessive phenotype** - you will always know the genotype for this: **homozygous recessive**. Remember that the dominant phenotype is seen in both homozygous dominant, and heterozygous individuals.  Also, don’t mix up the Hardy-Weinberg equations with the Hardy-Weinberg principle. The **equations** are used to **estimate** the allele and genotype **frequencies** in a population. The **principle** suggests that there is an **equilibrium** between allele frequencies and there is no change in this between generations.
