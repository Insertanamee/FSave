## Determining the Time of Death

* **Forensics** is the use of science in the **investigation of criminal activities**

  + It involves the **collection and analysis of evidence** from a potential crime scene e.g. the scene at which a dead body is found
* Determining the **time of death** (TOD) of a body is a very important component of **forensic science**

  + The TOD can be used during a police investigation to provide information about the **circumstances surrounding the death** of a person
* In order to accurately estimate TOD, there are **several factors** that must be established

  + Extent of decomposition
  + Stage of succession
  + Forensic entomology
  + Body temperature of the deceased
  + The degree of muscle contraction

#### Extent of decomposition

* The process of decomposition begins soon after death

  + Decomposition is carried out by organisms known as **decomposers** e.g. bacteria and fungi

    - Enzymes secreted from the cells of these organisms break down biological molecules in dead tissue
* The time since death can often be established visually by looking at the appearance of a body that is decomposing

  + Decomposers break down **cells and tissues** over the course of a few days

    - At this stage in decomposition the appearance of the skin can be a helpful indication of time since death; **skin will often appear greenish in colour**
  + The next stage of decomposition involves the **breakdown of tissues and organs** by micro-organisms over the course of a few days or weeks

    - This process produces gases, such as methane, which will lead to **bloating**
    - The **skin will blister and fall off** the rest of the body
  + A few **weeks after death** the remains of the soft tissues will **turn to liquid** which becomes visible as it **leaves the body**
  + This process will continue over the course of **months or years** until only a **skeleton** remain
  + After a **few decades or centuries,** the skeleton will **disintegrate** until nothing remains
* The rate of decomposition will be affected by factors such as **temperature** and **availability of oxygen**

  + Decomposition would be slower in anaerobic conditions and at lower temperatures but would be faster at high temperatures

#### Stage of succession

* Succession refers to the **change in the types of organisms** found in a habitat over time

  + This is often an ecology term that is applied to a habitat such as a pond or woodland, but in this case the **habitat is the dead body**

    - The difference between succession in ecology and in forensics is that in an ecosystem the early pioneer species are out-competed and disappear as the system matures, while in a dead body **all of the newly arriving species remain as decomposition progresses**
* The **stage of succession** of a body can provide information about the estimated TOD
* **Above ground** the body would undergo the following stages of succession

  + **Bacteria** will be found in and on the dead body immediately after TOD
  + As tissue decomposition sets in it creates ideal conditions for **flies** to lay eggs and their **larvae** to hatch
  + As more soft tissue is consumed by the fly larvae it creates favourable conditions for **beetles** to establish
  + When **tissue dries out** over time **flies will leave** the body as they prefer a moisture-rich environment
  + **Beetles**, however, can decompose dry tissue so they **will remain** on the body
  + Once all tissues have been decomposed most organisms will leave the body
* These **succession stages will differ** depending on where the body is located as the **accessibility to insects** and **availability of oxygen** will be affected e.g.

  + Buried in soil
  + Buried in a coffin
  + Under water

#### Forensic entomology

* A dead body provides an ideal habitat for many **species of insects;** the study of these insect colonies is known as **forensic entomology**
* **Different insect species** will colonise a body at different times after death, providing information about the TOD

  + Flies will be found on the body within a few hours after death, while beetles will only colonise the body later

* Another clue that insects can provide is the **stage of life cycle** they are at

  + E.g. blowfly eggs will hatch after about 24 hours so if larvae are present on the body it indicates that the person died more than 24 hours ago

    - Other insects have longer life cycles, so if **only** blowfly larvae are found it indicates that **only** 24 hours has passed since TOD
  + Factors that might affect the **progression of insect life cycles** include

    - Drugs that may be present in the body
    - Humidity of the surroundings
    - Oxygen availability
    - Temperature

#### Body temperature

* Respiration and other metabolic processes **produce heat** in living organisms

  + This heat is necessary for maintaining our body temperature at around **37 °C** during life
* Once a person dies **metabolic reactions** will eventually **come to an end**

  + Since no more heat is produced the **body temperature** **drops** until it reaches the temperature of the surrounding environment
  + This process of cooling is known as ***algor mortis***
* Body temperature decreases by **1.5**-**2.0 °C** **per hour**, therefore providing forensic scientists with a way to determine the TOD based on the temperature of the body
* Certain conditions will affect the rate at which body heat is lost e.g.

  + Air temperature
  + Surface area : volume ratio
  + Presence of clothing

#### Degree of muscle contraction

* **Muscles** in the body begin to **contract** about 4-6 hours after TOD, leading to a general stiffening of the body known as ***rigor mortis***
* *Rigor mortis* comes about as a result of changes to the proteins in muscle cells after death

  + Since **no more oxygen** reaches the muscle cells after death they will start to **respire anaerobically,** producing **lactic acid**
  + The accumulation of lactic acid **decreases the pH** in the muscle cells, **denaturing the enzymes** that produce ATP
  + Without ATP the myosin heads **cannot be released** from the actin filaments, **locking the muscles in a contracted state**

    - Muscles contract due to the action of two protein filaments; myosin and actin
    - The binding of myosin heads to actin proteins followed by the bending of the myosin heads causes muscle contraction
    - ATP is required to allow the myosin heads to detach from the binding sites on actin
  + This leads to the stiffness that is the main characteristic of *rigor mortis*
* *Rigor mortis* will begin in the smaller muscles of the head and end in the larger muscles of the lower body, meaning that forensic experts can determine TOD by the progress of *rigor mortis*through the body

  + *Rigor mortis* would have taken place in every muscle between 12 and 18 hours after death, but will wear off again after about 24 to 36 hours from TOD
* The process is affected by the **level of muscle development** and the **temperature of the surroundings**

  + Higher temperatures will speed up the rate of *rigor mortis*

#### Examiner Tips and Tricks

Remember that the time of death is only an estimate, it cannot be pinpointed exactly. There are so many factors that will affect a dead body that it is nearly impossible to provide a time of death that will be precisely accurate. Keep this in mind when answering questions on this topic.
