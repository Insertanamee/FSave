prescribed <b>antibiotics </b></p></li><li><p>Antibiotics are chemical substances that<b> damage bacterial cells</b> with little or no harm to human tissue</p><ul><li><p><b>Penicillin</b> is a well-known example; it was discovered in 1928 by Sir Alexander Fleming</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Antibiotics are either  </p><ul><li><p><b>Bactericidal; </b>they kill bacterial cells</p></li><li><p><b>Bacteriostatic; </b>they inhibit bacterial growth processes </p><ul><li><p>Note that bacteriostatic antibiotics given at a high enough dose will result in the death of bacterial cells</p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p>Antibiotics work by <b>interfering with the growth or metabolism of the target bacterium </b>e.g.</p><ul><li><p><b>Inhibiting bacterial enzymes</b> needed to form bonds in the cell walls; this prevents bacterial growth and can cause death</p><ul><li><p>Cell walls are weakened and burst under the pressure of water entering the cell by osmosis</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Binding to ribosomes and <b>preventing protein synthesis;</b> this inhibits enzyme production, stopping metabolic processes in the bacterial cell</p></li><li><p>Damaging cell membranes, leading to <b>loss of useful metabolites</b> or <b>uncontrolled entry of water</b></p></li><li><p>Preventing bacterial DNA from coiling into rings, meaning that it <b>no longer fits into the bacterial cell</b></p></li></ul></li><li><p>Since mammalian cells are <b>eukaryotic,</b> they <b>will not be damaged </b>by antibiotics</p><ul><li><p>They do not have cell walls</p></li><li><p>They have different enzymes</p></li><li><p>They have different ribosomes</p></li></ul></li><li><p><b>Viruses</b> do not have cellular structures such as enzymes, ribosomes, and cell walls so they <b>are not affected</b> by antibiotics</p></li></ul><div class="mb-5" data-type="image"><img alt="How antibiotics work" class="ContentBlock_figure__6whpf"

work in a <b>sterile environment</b></p><ul><li><p>Sterile refers to the <b>absence of microorganisms</b></p><ul><li><p>Equipment can be sterilised by washing at high temperatures or with antibacterial chemicals</p></li><li><p>Work benches can be wiped with antibacterial chemicals</p></li><li><p>An updraft can be created to ensure sterile air around a work space e.g. by placing a

up a Bunsen burner</p><ul><li><p>The Bunsen burner will create an <b>updraft</b> and prevent microorganisms in the air from landing in the work area</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Transfer some of the bacterial culture on to an agar plate using a sterile pipette and spread it out using a sterile spreader or inoculating loop</p><ul><li><p>Plastic equipment can be set aside for <b>washing </b>after each use</p></li><li><p>Metal equipment, e.g. inoculating loops, can be <b>sterilised in a Bunsen flame</b> after each use</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Soak similar sized paper discs<b> </b>in different types of antibiotics, e.g. Methicillin, Tetracycline and Streptomycin</p><ul><li><p>An alternative to using different types of antibiotics could be to use different concentrations of the same antibiotic</p></li><li><p>Note that you can use paper discs that have been pre-treated with antibiotics as an alternative to soaking</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Add a negative control to the investigation by soaking a disc in distilled water</p><ul><li><p>This provides a point of comparison, demonstrating that any results gained are due to the changes in antibiotic type and not any other factor</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Space the discs apart on the agar plate using sterile forceps</p><ul><li><p>Place the forceps in a container filled with disinfectant after use, or<b> sterilise in a Bunsen flame</b></p></li></ul></li><li><p>Lightly tape a lid onto the petri dish, invert and incubate at 25 °C for 24 to 48 hours</p><ul><li><p>Lightly taping rather than sealing ensures that<b> oxygen is available</b> to the bacteria</p></li><li><p>Inverting the dish, i.e. storing it upside down, prevents condensation from dripping onto the agar, potentially <b>contaminating</b> the dish</p></li><li><p>Incubating at around room temperature prevents the growth of <b>harmful pathogens</b>; research laboratories may use warmer temperatures to achieve faster results</p></li></ul></li></ol><ul><li><p>Bacteria will grow to form a 'lawn' on top of the agar</p></li><li><p>Any clear patches in the lawn will indicate where bacteria could not grow</p><ul><li><p>This is called the <b>clear zone</b></p></li></ul></li></ul><h4 id="interpretation-of-results">Interpretation of results</h4><ul><li><p>The <b>larger the clear zone</b>, the <b>more effective the antibiotic</b> was at inhibiting bacterial growth</p></li><li><p>If <b>no clear zone</b> is present, it means that the bacteria is <b>resistant </b>to that type of antibiotic</p></li><li><p>The sizes of the clear zones can be compared between the <b>different types of antibiotics</b>, as well as the <b>different concentrations of each</b></p></li></ul><div
