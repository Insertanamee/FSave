## Evolutionary Race Between Pathogens & Host

* Vertebrates have evolved over millions of years to have immune systems that are capable of dealing with a wide range of different pathogens
* **Pathogens**, however, have also evolved and have developed different ways of **evading their host's immune system**
* This battle between host and pathogen is known as an **evolutionary race**; each organism develops new ways in which to have an advantage over the other

  + This evolutionary race is sometimes referred to as an **evolutionary arms race**
* Evasion mechanisms developed by pathogens serve as support for this theory

#### HIV evasion mechanisms

* The virus **kills helper T cells** after it infects them which reduces the number of cells that could detect the presence of the virus and activate the production of antibodies
* HIV shows **antigenic variability** due to the high mutation rate in the genes coding for antigen proteins

  + This forms **new strains** of the virus which each require a new primary immune response

    - Memory cells for one strain **will not recognise** the antigens of another strain
* The virus **prevents** infected cells from**presenting their antigens** on the cell surface membrane, making it very difficult for the relevant white blood cells to recognise and destroy the infected cells

#### Mycobacterium tuberculosis evasion mechanisms

* Once engulfed by phagocytes in the lungs the bacteria produce substances that will **prevent a** lysosome from fusing with the phagocytic vacuole

  + This prevents the bacteria from being broken down by digestive enzymes, leaving them to **multiply** within the phagocyte
* As with HIV the bacteria can **disrupt antigen presentation** in infected phagocytes, making it difficult for the immune system to recognise and destroy these cells
