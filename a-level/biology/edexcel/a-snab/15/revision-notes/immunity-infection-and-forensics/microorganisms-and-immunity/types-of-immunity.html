encountered</b></p></li><li><p>This launches a <b>primary immune response</b> consisting of a <b>non-specific immune response</b> followed by a <b>specific immune response</b></p><ul><li><p>The primary response occurs the <b>first time</b> an antigen is encountered by the immune system</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Since it is the first time the immune system has encountered the antigen, the numbers of <b>T and B cells with the correct membrane receptors</b> present in the blood will be <b>low</b></p></li><li><p>It will <b>take time</b> for the correct T and B cells to be activated and to divide and differentiate into different cell types</p><ul><li><p>It can take several days before <b>plasma cells </b>develop and are able to start producing <b>antibodies</b> against an antigen</p></li><li><p>This is the reason why an infected person will <b>experience symptoms</b> of the disease the first time they contract it</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Both T and B cells produce <b>memory cells</b> during the primary response, which will remain in the blood after an infection is over</p><ul><li><p>The presence of memory cells means that a person is said to be <b>immune</b> to the pathogen</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Should the immune system encounter the same antigen again in the future it will launch a <b>secondary immune response</b> which will be much <b>faster</b> and <b>stronger </b>than the primary response</p><ul><li><p>Memory cells are present in larger quantities than the mature lymphocytes at the start of the primary response, so the correct memory cells are able to detect an antigen, activate, multiply by mitosis, and differentiate much more quickly</p></li><li><p>Antibodies are produced <b>more quickly</b> and in <b>larger quantities</b> in a secondary response</p></li></ul></li><li><p>This will often eliminate the pathogen <b>before the infected person can show symptoms</b></p></li></ul><div class="mb-5" data-type="image"><img alt="Antibody
