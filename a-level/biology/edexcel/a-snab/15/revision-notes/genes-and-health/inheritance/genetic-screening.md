## Genetic Screening: Uses

* Some circumstances, e.g. in a pregnancy where there is a family history of a genetic disorder, may require individuals to determine if they have a particular allele present in their genome
* This can be determined by **genetic screening**
* There are three main uses of genetic screening

  + Identifying individuals who are **carrying an allele at a gene locus for a particular disorder**
  + The screening of embryos prior to implantation during fertility treatment; this is **Preimplantation** **Genetic Diagnosis** (PGD)
  + Testing a foetus before birth; this is **prenatal testing**

#### Identification of carriers

* Carrier testing is offered to individuals with a **history** of genetic disorders in their family
* It can show whether people who have no symptoms **carry the allele** for particular disorders, such as cystic fibrosis
* Couples can be tested prior to having children to **determine the probability of future children inheriting the disorder**
* Benefits

  + Families can make **informed decisions** before having children
  + Women can decide whether to have **prenatal testing** during pregnancy

#### Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis

* IVF, or *in vitro* fertilisation is a type of fertility treatment during which **fertilisation is carried out in the lab;** embryos produced in this way can be **implanted into the uterus** where they develop into a foetus
* PGD involves **analysis of the DNA of an embryo** prior to implanting it into the uterus

  + The sample of DNA to be analysed can be obtained by taking**cell samples from** **embryos** produced during IVF
* Benefits

  + Reduces the chances of having a baby with a genetic disorder
  + It avoids abortion as it is carried out before implantation of the embryo

#### Prenatal testing

* Prenatal testing is offered to pregnant women with a family history of genetic disorders
* It involves testing the foetus for genetic diseases
* The DNA can be obtained by **chorionic villus sampling** or **amniocentesis** of embryos and foetuses in the uterus
* Chorionic villus sampling

  + This involves removing and testing a small sample of cells **from the placenta** using a fine needle
  + The cells contain foetal DNA which can be **analysed for genetic disorders**, allowing parents to make informed decisions about the pregnancy and foetus
  + It is carried out at around 11-14 weeks of pregnancy
  + The process has a  1-2 % risk of miscarriage
* Amniocentesis

  + This involves removing and testing a small sample of cells **from amniotic fluid** using a fine needle

    - The amniotic fluid is the fluid that surrounds the foetus within the uterus
  + The fluid contains **foetal cells** which contain **DNA to be analysed**
  + It is carried out at around 15-20 weeks of pregnancy
  + The procedure has a 1% risk of miscarriage
* Benefits

  + The tests allow parents to make informed decisions
  + Results can help parents prepare for the future care of the child, including medical treatment

## Genetic Screening: Social & Ethical Issues

* Genetic screening comes with a range of different social and ethical issues
* As genetic screening can leave future parents with many questions, **genetic counsellors** are available to help

  + Counsellors can be seen **before screening** has occurred; they may discuss the following with the prospective parents

    - The probability of the couple having a child with a genetic disorder
    - Termination of the pregnancy
    - Therapeutic treatments possible for the child
    - Financial implications of having the child
    - Effect on existing siblings
    - Ethical issues
  + After screening the counsellors will read the results and **explain them** to the future parents

* Each use of genetic screening brings **potential concerns** that should be considered

  + Identification of Carriers

    - Finding out you are a carrier can cause **emotional stress** and upset
    - It may impact your ability to find a partner
    - **Other genetic disorders** may be identified
    - **Employers** and **insurance companies** may use the data against an individual
    - The tests are **not always 100 % accurate;** false positives or negatives may be given
  + Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis

    - There are concerns it could lead to "designer babies" where **parents select embryos** with certain traits such as eye colour or sex
    - False results could lead to inaccurate information and **poor decisions being made** about the fate of embryos
  + Prenatal testing

    - Each procedure brings **risk of miscarriage**
    - False results could provide inaccurate information and **poor decisions** being made
    - There are **ethical implications** involved if parents decide to abort the fetus
