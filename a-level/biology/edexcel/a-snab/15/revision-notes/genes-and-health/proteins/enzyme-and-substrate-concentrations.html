removed from a reaction</p></li><li><p>This can be done using a range of substrate concentrations to investigate how changing concentration effects the rate of the reaction</p></li><li><p>The breakdown of starch by amylase is a good example of how to investigate the effect of substrate concentration on the rate of the reaction</p></li><li><p>Iodine solution can be added to a starch solution to create a solution with a blue-black appearance</p></li><li><p>This will provide a measurable way of determining the rate at which starch is broken down to maltose using a colorimeter</p></li><li><p>The colorimeter will measure how the absorbance of the starch solution change over a period of time once amylase is added to it</p></li><li><p>This can be repeated for a range of different starch concentrations and a graph of absorbance against time can be plotted</p></li><li><p>Results should show a fast initial rate of reaction and then plateau out as the substrate is converted into product(s) and all available active sites become occupied by the increasing concentration of substrate</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="col-12"><div class="Wrapper_wrapper__raXe4

It is also important to control other variables such as pH and temperature to ensure these do not have an effect on the activity of the enzyme.</p></div></div></div></div>
