id="translation">Translation</h2><ul><li><p>Translation occurs <b>in the cytoplasm</b> of the cell</p></li><li><p>After leaving the nucleus via a nuclear pore, the <b>mRNA molecule attaches to a ribosome</b></p></li><li><p>In the cytoplasm there are <b>free molecules of tRNA</b> (transfer RNA)</p><ul><li><p>tRNA is a single stranded molecule of RNA that folds into a clover-like structre</p></li><li><p>tRNA molecules have a <b>triplet of unpaired bases at one end, </b>known as the <b>anticodon</b>, and a region at the other end where a specific <b>amino acid can attach</b></p></li><li><p>There are about 20 different tRNA molecules, each with a <b>specific anticodon</b> and <b>specific amino acid </b>binding site</p></li></ul></li><li><p>The <b>tRNA molecules bind with their specific amino acids</b> (also in the cytoplasm) and bring them to the mRNA molecule on the <b>ribosome</b></p></li><li><p>The triplet of bases (anticodon) on each tRNA molecule pairs with a<b> complementary triplet</b> on the mRNA molecule called the <b>codon</b></p><ul><li><p>Near the beginning of the mRNA is a triplet of bases called the <b>start codon (AUG)</b></p></li><li><p>This is a signal to <b>start off translation </b></p></li><li><p>AUG codes for an <b>amino acid </b>called <b>methionine</b></p></li></ul></li><li><p><b>Two tRNA molecules fit onto the ribosome at any one time</b>, bringing the amino acid they are each carrying side by side</p></li><li><p>A <b>peptide bond</b> is then formed, via a <b>condensation reaction</b>, between the two amino acids</p></li><li><p>This process continues until a <b>‘stop’ codon </b>on the mRNA molecule is reached – this acts as a signal for translation to stop and at this point the amino acid chain coded for by the mRNA molecule is <b>complete</b></p></li><li><p>The amino acid chain then forms the <b>final</b> <b>polypeptide</b></p></li></ul><div class="mb-5" data-type="image"><img alt="Process
