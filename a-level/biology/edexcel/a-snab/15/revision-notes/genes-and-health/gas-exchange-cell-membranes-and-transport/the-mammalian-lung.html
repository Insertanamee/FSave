travel to the lungs</p></li><li><p>It contains c-shaped rings of <b>cartilage</b> that ensure that the tube <b>remains open</b> at all times and does not collapse</p><ul><li><p>The c-shape prevents any friction from rubbing with the oesophagus located close behind, as well as providing increased flexibility when food is being swallowed</p></li></ul></li><li><p>There is a layer of <b>mucus</b> covering the lining of the trachea that helps to <b>trap dust and pathogens</b>, preventing them from entering the lungs where they could cause infection</p><ul><li><p>Tiny hairs called <b>cilia</b> are also found on the lining of the airways, where they <b>waft mucus</b> towards the top of the trachea, removing any trapped particles and pathogens from the airways</p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p><b>Bronchi</b></p><ul><li><p>Bronchi (singular bronchus) have a similar structure to the trachea but they have <b>thinner walls</b> and a <b>smaller diameter</b></p></li><li><p>The cartilage rings in the bronchi are full circles rather than c-shaped</p></li></ul></li><li><p><b>Bronchioles</b></p><ul><li><p>Bronchioles are narrow, self-supporting tubes with thin walls</p></li><li><p>There is a <b>large number of bronchioles</b> present in the gas exchange system</p></li><li><p>Each one varies in size, getting smaller as they get closer to the alveoli</p></li><li><p>The larger bronchioles possess <b>elastic fibres and smooth muscle </b>that enable adjustment of the size of the airway to increase or decrease airflow</p><ul><li><p>The

bronchioles</p></li><li><p>The <b>alveolar wall</b> consists of a <b>single layer of flattened</b>, or <b>squamous</b>, <b>epithelium</b></p><ul><li><p>The squamous epithelium forms the alveolar wall

gases</p><ul><li><p>Oxygen and carbon dioxide are able to <b>dissolve</b> in the layer of moisture, so exchange occurs <b>in solution </b>rather than with the air inside the
