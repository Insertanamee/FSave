## Practical: Investigating the Rate of Respiration

* Respirometers are used to measure and investigate the **rate of oxygen consumption**during aerobic respiration in organisms
* The experiments usually involve organisms such as seeds or invertebrates

#### Apparatus

* Respirometer
* Glass beads
* Germinating seeds

  + These will be actively respiring and consuming oxygen
* Test tubes
* Soda-lime pellets (or potassium hydroxide)

  + To absorb the carbon dioxide produced
* Stopwatch

***A respirometer set up to measure the rate of respiration***

#### Method

* **Measure oxygen consumption**: set up the respirometer and run the experiment with both tubes for a set amount of time (e.g. 30 minutes)
* As the seeds consume oxygen, the **volume of air** in the test tube **will decrease** (CO2 produced during respiration is absorbed by soda lime or KOH)
* This **reduces the pressure** in the capillary tube and **manometer fluid will move towards** the test tube containing the seeds
* Measure the distance moved by the liquid in a given time
* Use this measurement to calculate the change in gas volume within a given time, *x* cm3min-1
* **Reset the apparatus**: Allow air to re-enter the tubes via the screw cap and reset the manometer fluid using the syringe
* **Repeat** experiment several times and calculate the **average volume of oxygen consumed**

#### Calculations

* The volume of oxygen consumed (cm3 min-1) can be worked out using:

  + The diameter of the capillary tube*r* (cm)
  + The distance moved by the manometer fluid *h* (cm) in a minute using the formula:

**πr****2****h**

#### Examiner Tips and Tricks

It is important to note that when using living organisms such as woodlice or maggots you must treat them with respect and do not harm them.
