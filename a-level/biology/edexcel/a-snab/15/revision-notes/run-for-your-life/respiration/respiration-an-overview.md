## Respiration: An Overview

* **Glucose** is the main respiratory substrate used by cells
* Aerobic respiration is the process of breaking down a respiratory substrate in order to **produce ATP using oxygen**
* The equation for aerobic respiration:

**glucose + oxygen →  carbon dioxide + water + energy**

**C****6****H****12****0****6****+ 6 O****2****→  6 CO****2****+ 6 H****2****0 + 2870kJ**

* The energy that is released during the process is used to phosphorylate (add a phosphate) ADP to form ATP
* The ATP provides energy for other biological processes in cells
* The process of aerobic respiration using glucose can be split into four stages:

  + **Glycolysis**
  + The **Link reaction**
  + The **Krebs cycle**
  + **Oxidative phosphorylation**
* Glycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm of the cell, while the other three stages all occur within different parts of the mitochondria
* The reactions in each stage of respiration are **controlled by enzymes** found inside the cell
* The enzyme that catalyses these reactions the **slowest** will determine the **overall rate of aerobic respiration**
* Several **coenzymes** are required during respiration to **transfer** various molecules involved in the process

  + **NAD** and **FAD** are the coenzymes responsible for **transferring hydrogen** between molecules
  + Depending on whether they give or take hydrogen, they are able to **reduce** or **oxidise** a molecule
  + **Coenzyme A** is responsible for the **transfer of acetate** (also known as acetic acid) from one molecule to another
* Although glucose is the main fuel for respiration, organisms can also break down other molecules (such as fatty acids or amino acids) to be respired

#### Structure of mitochondria

* Mitochondria have two phospholipid membranes
* The **outer membrane** is:

  + Smooth
  + Permeable to several small molecules
* The **inner membrane** is:

  + Folded (cristae)
  + **Less permeable**
  + The site of the **electron transport chain**(used in oxidative phosphorylation)
  + Location of**ATP synthase enzymes**(used in oxidative phosphorylation)
* The **intermembrane space**:

  + Has a low pH due to the **high concentration of protons**
  + The concentration gradient across the inner membrane is formed during oxidative phosphorylation and is **essential for ATP synthesis**
* The **matrix**:

  + Is an aqueous solution within the inner membranes of the mitochondrion
  + Contains ribosomes, enzymes and circular mitochondrial DNA necessary for mitochondria to function
