## Calculating Cardiac Output

* **Cardiac output** (CO) is the term used to describe the volume of blood that is pumped by the heart (the left and right ventricle) per unit of time
* An average adult has a cardiac output of roughly 4.7 litres of blood per minute when at **rest**
* Individuals who are **fitter** often have **higher cardiac outputs** due to having thicker and stronger ventricular muscles in their hearts
* Cardiac output **increases** when an individual is **exercising**

  + This is so that the blood supply can match the increased metabolic demands of the cells
* The CO of an individual can be calculated using their **heart rate** and **stroke volume**
* **Heart rate** is the **number of times a heart beats per minute**

  + This can also be described as the number of cardiac cycles per minute
* **Stroke volume** is the **volume of blood pumped out of the left ventricle during one cardiac cycle**

***Graph showing the changes in the volume of the left ventricle within one cardiac cycle; this is the stroke volume***

### Cardiac output formula

* Cardiac output is found by multiplying the heart rate by the stroke volume:

**Cardiac output = heart rate x stroke volume**

* The equation can be rearranged to find the heart rate and stroke volume if required:

  + Heart rate = cardiac output ÷ stroke volume
  + Stroke volume = cardiac output ÷ heart rate
* **Cardiac output** is measured in **cm****3** **min****-1**
* **Heart rate** is measured in **beats per min** (bpm)
* **Stroke volume** is measured in **cm****3**

#### Worked Example

A woman took 1.2 seconds to complete a single cardiac cycle. The stroke volume of her heart was measured at 75 cm3. Calculate the cardiac output, give your answer in dm3.

**Answer:**  
  
**Step 1: Find the heart rate**

One cardiac cycle (atrial systole, ventricular systole and diastole) takes 1.2 seconds

To find the number of cardiac cycles completed in a minute, multiply by 60

60 x 1.2 = 72 bpm

**Step 2: Insert relevant figures into the equation**

Cardiac output = heart rate x stroke volume

Cardiac output = 72 x 75 = 5,400 cm3

Cardiac output = **5.40 dm****3**

#### Worked Example

An athlete runs a 10 km marathon, after which his heart rate was measured at 110 bpm and his cardiac output was determined to be 9,800 cm3.

Calculate the stroke volume after the marathon.

**Answer:**  
  
Stroke volume = cardiac output ÷ heart rate

Stroke volume = 9,800 ÷ 110

Stroke volume = **89.09 cm****3**

#### Examiner Tips and Tricks

1 dm3is equal to 1000 cm3. It can be useful to convert all the figures found in the first question into the **same units** before starting your workout, that way you are less likely to make any mistakes!
