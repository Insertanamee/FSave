## ECGs & Diagnosing CVD

* Electrocardiography can be used to monitor and investigate the electrical activity of the heart
* **Electrodes** that are capable of detecting electric signals are placed on the skin
* These electrodes produce an **electrocardiogram** (ECG)
* An ECG shows a number of distinctive **electrical waves produced by the activity of the heart**
* A healthy heart produces a distinctive shape in an ECG

***The ECG of a healthy heart***

* **The P wave**

  + Caused by the depolarisation of the atria, which results in atrial contraction (systole)
* **The QRS complex**

  + Caused by the depolarisation of the ventricles, which results in ventricular contraction (systole)
  + This is the largest wave because the ventricles have the largest muscle mass
* **The T wave**

  + Caused by the repolarisation of the ventricles, which results in ventricular relaxation (diastole)
* **The U wave**

  + Scientists are still uncertain of the cause of the U wave, some think it is caused by the repolarisation of the Purkyne fibres
* The **bigger** the wave, the **greater** the electrical activity passing through the heart, which results in a **stronger contraction**

#### Using ECGs to diagnose heart problems

* If someone has a suspected heart problem a doctor will often use an ECG as a diagnostic tool
* Some heart problems produce certain shapes or waves in an ECG which allow for a diagnosis
* **Tachycardia**

  + When the **heart beats too fast** it is tachycardic
  + An individual with a resting heart rate of over 100 bpm is said to have tachycardia
* **Bradycardia**

  + When the **heart beats too slow** it is bradycardic
  + An individual with a resting heart rate below 60 bpm is said to have bradycardia
  + A lot of fit individuals or athletes tend to have lower heart rates and it is usually not dangerous
* **Ectopic heartbeat**

  + This condition is caused by an **early heartbeat followed by a pause**
  + This could be due to an earlier contraction of either the atria or ventricles
  + It is common in the population and usually requires no treatment unless very severe
* **Fibrillation**

  + An **irregular heartbeat** will disrupt the rhythm of the heart
  + The atria or ventricles stop contracting properly
  + Severe cases of fibrillation can be very dangerous, even fatal

***Each of these ECGs shows different faulty heartbeats. The speed or rhythm/regularity of the heartbeat is very important***
