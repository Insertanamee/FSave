## Modern Medicine & Participation in Sports

#### Keyhole surgery

* **Sports injuries** are a common occurrence since the body is placed **under stress** when participating in sporting activities
* Some of these injuries can result in **permanent damage**, but with the correct treatment it is possible to make a full recovery from sports injuries
* **Advances in medical technology** has enabled professional athletes to recover from injuries that previously may have ended their career
* **Keyhole surgery** is one example of the medical advances that have been made

  + It is a **less invasive** procedure as only **small incisions** are made in the skin
  + A **small video camera** is inserted into the incision, along with **specialised medical instruments** with which to perform the surgery
  + There are multiple **advantages of keyhole surgery** compared to conventional surgery:

    - **Less blood loss** and **scarring** of the skin
    - **Less pain** after surgery and a **quicker recovery**
    - This leads to a **shorter hospital stay** and the patient can **quickly return** to doing normal activities
* An example of keyhole surgery is fixing a **damaged cruciate ligament**

  + The cruciate ligaments are found in the **middle of the knee** and it **connects** the **thigh bone** to the **lower leg bone**
  + The damaged ligament can be removed and **replaced by a graft** from another tendon in the patient's leg or from a donor's tendon

#### Prostheses

* Injuries may sometimes result in people **losing or damaging a body part** to the extent that they can no longer use it
* In some cases, a person may be born **without** certain body parts
* In both these cases, the missing or damaged body part may be replaced with an **artificial version** called a **prosthesis**

  + They may replace **entire limbs** (e.g. legs or hands) or **parts of limbs** (e.g. hip or knee joints)
  + Some prostheses may be **connected to electronic devices** that can 'read' information form the nervous system in order to operate the body part (e.g. hand prostheses enabling the user to move the fingers)
* Prostheses enables individuals to **participate in sport again,** even after serious injuries
* An example of the use of a prosthesis is **replacing a damaged knee joint**

  + The damaged cartilage and bone is replaced by a **metal device** on both long bones to create a smooth surface for articulation
  + A plastic spacer is often inserted between the metal ends of the prosthesis to provide **cushioning** and **reduce the impact** on the knee
  + The knee prosthesis enables those with serious knee injuries to be **more mobile** and even participate in **low-impact sports**

## Use of Performance-enhancing Drugs in Sports

* Drugs that can improve a person's performance in sport or athletic activities are known as **performance-enhancing drugs**
* When taken by people participating in competitive sporting events, it will give them an **unfair advantage** over their opponents
* There are many different kinds of performance-enhancing drugs that may affect the body in different ways

  + **Anabolic steroids** which **increase muscle size** to give the user **increased strength, speed** and **stamina** but may lead to organ damage and increased aggression
  + **Stimulants** which make the used **more alert** and able to **react faster**, they will have greater endurance but it may also lead to aggressive behaviour
  + **Narcotic analgesics** which are very **strong painkillers** that enables users to **maintain their performance** despite suffering from injuries
* Due to the **enhanced performance** and **health risks** associated with taking these drugs, they are **banned** from most competitive sports
* **Random drug tests** are performed on athletes and if the results are positive, they may be banned from competing and may lose any medals or awards that they have won in the past

#### Ethical positions on the use of performance-enhancing drugs

* There are two groups with opposing views on the use of performance-enhancing drugs

  + **Rationalists** think there may be times when their use is justified
  + **Absolutists** think that they are morally wrong and should be banned from all sport

#### Arguments for the use of performance-enhancing drugs

* This view is supported by **rationalists** who believe these drugs should be allowed under certain circumstances

  + Athletes should have the **freedom to choose** whether they want to deal with the risks of taking these drugs
  + Performance-enhancing drugs **may help overcome inequalities** in competitive sport, since athletes have do not have access to the same opportunities to improve themselves (e.g. facilities, training equipment or coaches)
  + **Competing at a higher level** may only be possible for some athletes if they are using performance-enhancing drugs

#### Arguments against the use of performance-enhancing drugs

* This view is supported by **absolutists** who believe these drugs should be banned from all sports and not be taken under any circumstance

  + Many performance-enhancing drugs are **illegal**
  + These drugs give athletes an **unfair advantage** over those who do not take them. Performance should be the result of training and hard work only
  + The **health risks** associated with these drugs are serious, and include a variety of side effects
  + There is the question of whether athletes are **fully informed** about the health risks involved with taking these drugs
