## Variations in Breathing Rate & Heart Rate

* During exercise, **muscle contraction** occurs **more frequently**, requiring **more energy**
* The **rate of** **aerobic respiration** **increases** to meet the increase in energy demand
* This means that cells **require more oxygen** to be delivered to them, while **producing more carbon dioxide** as a waste product of respiration
* The body will accommodate this by making the following changes:

  + **Increase the rate and depth of breathing** which will increase the amount of oxygen entering the lungs and bloodstream, while getting rid of more carbon dioxide
  + **Increase the heart rate** which will transport the oxygen (and glucose) to the muscles much faster, while removing the additional carbon dioxide produced due to the increased rate of respiration

#### Control of the breathing rate

* Breathing rate is controlled by the **ventilation centres** (also called respiratory centres) in the **medulla oblongata**

  + This is one of the three regions that make up the brainstem, it transfers nerve messages from the brain to the spinal cord
  + The **inspiratory centre** controls the movement of air into the lungs (inhalation)
  + The **expiratory centre** controls the movement of air out of the lungs (exhalation)
* The **inspiratory centre** in the medulla oblongata has the following effect on breathing:

  + It sends **nerve impulses** along motor neurons to the **intercostal** **muscles** of the ribs and **diaphragm muscles**
  + These muscles will **contract** and cause the **volume of the chest to increase**
  + This **lowers the air pressure in the lungs** to slightly below atmospheric pressure
  + An **impulse** is also sent to the **expiratory centre** to **inhibit** its action
  + Due to the difference in pressure between the lungs and outside air, **air will flow into** the lungs
* **Stretch receptors** in the lungs are stimulated as they inflate with air
* Nerve impulses are sent back to the medulla oblongata which will **inhibit the inspiratory centre**
* The **expiratory centre** is no longer inhibited and will bring about the following changes:

  + It sends **nerve impulses** to the **intercostal** and **diaphragm muscles**
  + These muscles will **relax** and cause the **volume of the chest to decrease**
  + This **increases the air pressure** in the lungs to slightly above atmospheric pressure
  + Due to the higher pressure in the lungs, **air will flow out** of the lungs
* As the lungs **deflate**, the **stretch receptors become inactive** which means that the inspiratory centre is **no longer inhibited** and the next breathing cycle can begin

#### Effect of exercise

* The **extra carbon dioxide** that is produced **due to the increase in the rate of respiration** during exercise dissolves in the blood to form **carbonic acid**
* This quickly **dissociates into hydrogen ions** (H+) and hydrogencarbonate ions (HCO3-)
* The increase in the concentration of H+ ions will **decrease the pH of the blood** (it becomes more acidic)
* The decrease in pH is **detected by receptors** sensitive to changes in the chemical composition of blood
* These are called **chemoreceptors** and they are located in several places

  + In the ventilation centre of the **medulla oblongata**
  + They are also present as clusters of cells in the aorta (**aortic bodies**) and the carotid arteries (**carotid bodies**)
* Once they are stimulated a **nerve impulse** is sent to the **medulla oblongata**
* The medulla oblongata will then send **more frequent nerve impulses** to the intercostal and diaphragm muscles to increase the rate and strength of contractions
* This **increases** the breathing rate and depth
* This results in **more oxygen** entering the lungs (and bloodstream), while **more carbon dioxide** can be exhaled and thus be removed from the bloodstream
* The **decrease in carbon dioxide** levels will result in the **blood pH returning back to normal**, which leads to the breathing rate returning to normal
* The volume of air that moves in and out of the lungs during a set time period (e.g. a minute) is known as the **ventilation rate**
* The ventilation rate **increases during exercise** due to the increase in breathing rate and depth

#### Control of the heart rate

* The **cardiovascular control centre** in the **medulla oblongata** unconsciously **controls the heart rate** by controlling the rate at which the **sinoatrial node** (**SAN**) generates electrical impulses
* These electrical impulses cause the atria to contract and therefore **determines the rhythm of a heartbeat**
* Changes in the internal environment of the body (e.g. blood pressure, oxygen levels) can result in a change in the heart rate
* These changes act as **stimuli** which is detected by **baroreceptors** and **chemoreceptors**

  + **Baroreceptors** are found in the **aortic** and **carotid bodies** and they are stimulated by **high and low blood pressure**
  + **Chemoreceptors** are found in the **medulla oblongata**, as well as in the **aortic** and **carotid bodies**
  + They are stimulated by changes in the **levels of carbon dioxide** and **oxygen** in the blood, as well as **blood pH**
* Once stimulated, these receptors will **send electrical impulses** to the medulla oblongata
* The cardiovascular control centre in the medulla oblongata will respond by sending impulses to the SAN along **sympathetic** or **parasympathetic neurones**
* Each of these neurones release different **neurotransmitters** which will affect the SAN in a different way

  + **Sympathetic neurones** will increase the rate at which the SAN generates electrical impulses, thus **speeding up** the heart rate

    - These neurones form part of the **sympathetic nervous system** which prepares the body for **action** ('fight or flight' response) and **increases the heart rate** during exercise
  + **Parasympathetic neurones** will decrease the rate at which the SAN fires, thus **slowing down** the heart rate

    - These neurones form part of the **parasympathetic nervous system** which **calms** the body down after action ('rest and digest' response) and **decreases the heart rate** after exercise

#### Changes in heart rate

* The heart will respond in different way depending on the stimulus that it receives
* **High blood pressure**

  + Detected by **baroreceptors** which send impulses to **cardiovascular control centre**
  + It sends impulses along **parasympathetic** neurones which secrete the neurotransmitter **acetylcholine**
  + Acetylcholine binds to receptors on **SAN** causing it to fire **less frequently**
  + Heart rate **slows down** and blood pressure decreases back to normal
* **Low blood pressure**

  + Detected by **baroreceptors** which send impulses to **cardiovascular control centre**
  + It sends impulses along **sympathetic** neurones which secrete the neurotransmitter **noradrenaline**
  + Noradrenaline binds to receptors on **SAN** causing it to fire **more frequently**
  + Heart rate **speeds up** and blood pressure increases back to normal
* **High blood O****2** **/ Low CO****2** **/ high pH levels**

  + Detected by **chemoreceptors** which send impulses to **cardiovascular control centre**
  + It sends impulses along **parasympathetic** neurones which secrete the neurotransmitter **acetylcholine**
  + Acetylcholine binds to receptors on **SAN** causing it to fire **less frequently**
  + Heart rate **slows down** and O2 / CO2 and pH levels return to normal
* **Low blood O****2** **/ High CO****2** **/ low pH levels** (during **exercise**)

  + Detected by **chemoreceptors** which send impulses to **cardiovascular control centre**
  + It sends impulses along **sympathetic** neurones which secrete the neurotransmitter **noradrenaline**
  + Noradrenaline binds to receptors on **SAN** causing it to fire **more frequently**
  + Heart rate **speeds up** and O2 / CO2 and pH levels return to normal
