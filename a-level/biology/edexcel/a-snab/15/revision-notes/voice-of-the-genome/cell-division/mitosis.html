Cytokinesis is often mistaken as a stage of mitosis but remember this is a separate part of the cell cycle. </p><p>The acronym PMAT can be helpful to remind you what happens during each stage of mitosis:</p><p><b>P</b> = <b>P</b>rophase, where the cell <b>P</b>repares to divides</p><p><b>M </b>= <b>M</b>etaphase, where the chromosomes align along the <b>M</b>iddle</p><p><b>A</b> = <b>A</b>naphase, where the chromosomes move <b>A</b>way from each other</p><p><b>T</b> = <b>T</b>elophase, where <b>T</b>wo nuclei reform</p><p>The chromosome number is important too; after interphase but before the parent cell undergoes mitosis, the human parent cell nucleus actually contains <b>92 DNA molecules</b>! This is because during interphase (S phase), the 46 DNA molecules in the parent cell have replicated to form sister chromatids. As human cells have a diploid number of 46 this replication results in 92 molecules. This ensures the two daughter cells will be diploid (have 46 chromosomes each) when mitosis occurs. Remember to read the questions carefully as <b>only</b> human diploid cells have 46 chromosomes so if the question refers to another organism, its diploid number will be different.</p></div></div></div><div class="col-12"><div class="Wrapper_wrapper__raXe4 Card_card__7rJy4 bg-body-secondary rounded-3 p-4 card position-relative ContentBlock_content__MOc3W" data-type="specPoint"><h2 id="the-significance-of-mitosis">The Significance of Mitosis</h2><ul><li><p>The process of mitosis is of great biological significance and is <b>fundamental to many biological processes</b>:</p></li></ul><h4 id="growth-of-multicellular-organisms">Growth of multicellular organisms</h4><ul><li><p>The two daughter cells produced are genetically identical to one another (<b>clones</b>) and have the same number of chromosomes as the parent cell</p></li><li><p>This enables <b>unicellular zygotes</b> (as the zygote divides by mitosis) <b>to grow into multicellular organisms</b></p></li><li><p>Growth may occur across the whole body of the organism or be confined to certain regions, such as in the meristems (growing points) of plants</p></li></ul><h4 id="replacement-of-cells-repair-of-tissues">Replacement of cells &amp; repair of tissues</h4><ul><li><p>Damaged tissues can be repaired by mitosis followed by cell division</p></li><li><p>As cells are constantly dying they need to be <b>continually replaced by genetically identical cells</b></p></li><li><p>In humans, for example, cell replacement occurs particularly rapidly in the skin and the lining of the gut</p></li><li><p>Some animals can regenerate body parts, for example, zebrafish can regenerate fins and axolotls regenerate legs and their tail amongst other parts</p></li></ul><h4 id="asexual-reproduction">Asexual reproduction</h4><ul><li><p>Asexual reproduction is the production of new individuals of a species by a single parent organism – the offspring are genetically identical to the parent</p></li><li><p>For unicellular organisms such as <i>Amoeba</i>, cell division results in the reproduction of a genetically identical offspring</p></li><li><p>For multicellular organisms (as seen with many plant species) new individuals grow from the parent organism (by cell division) and then detach (‘bud off’) from the parent in different ways.
