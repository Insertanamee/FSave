class="text-center"><i><b>The stages of the cell cycle</b></i></p><h4 id="interphase">Interphase</h4><ul><li><p>During Interphase, the cell <b>increases in mass and size</b> and carries out its normal cellular functions (eg. synthesising proteins and replicating its DNA ready for mitosis)</p></li><li><p>Interphase consists of <b>three</b> phases:</p><ul><li><p><b>G</b><sub><b>1</b></sub><b> phase</b></p></li><li><p><b>S phase</b></p></li><li><p><b>G</b><sub><b>2</b></sub><b> phase</b></p></li></ul></li><li><p>It is at some point during the <b>G</b><sub><b>1</b></sub><b> phase</b> a <b>signal</b> is received telling the cell to <b>divide</b> again</p></li><li><p>The <b>DNA in the nucleus replicates </b>(resulting in each chromosome consisting of two identical sister chromatids)</p></li><li><p>This phase of the interphase stage of the cell cycle is called the <b>S phase</b> – <b>S</b> stands for <b>synthesis</b> (of DNA)</p><ul><li><p>The S phase is relatively short</p></li></ul></li><li><p>The gap between the previous cell division and the S phase is called the <b>G</b><sub><b>1</b></sub><b> phase</b> – <b>G</b> stands for <b>gap</b></p><ul><li><p><b>Cells make the RNA, enzymes and other proteins required for growth</b> during the G<sub>1</sub> phase</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Between the S phase and next cell division event the <b>G</b><sub><b>2</b></sub><b> phase </b>occurs</p><ul><li><p>During the G<sub>2</sub> phase, the <b>cell continues to grow and the new DNA that has been synthesised is checked</b> and any errors are usually repaired</p></li><li><p>Other preparations for cell division are made (eg. production of tubulin protein, which is used to make microtubules for the mitotic spindle)</p></li></ul></li><li><p><b>Interphase = G</b><sub><b>1</b></sub><b> + S + G</b><sub><b>2</b></sub></p></li></ul><h4 id="nuclear-division-mitosis">Nuclear division (mitosis)</h4><ul><li><p>Follows interphase</p></li><li><p>Referred to as the <b>M phase </b>– <b>M</b> stands for <b>mitosis</b></p></li><li><p><b>Cell growth stops</b> during the M phase</p></li></ul><h4 id="cytokinesis">Cytokinesis</h4><ul><li><p>Follows M phase</p></li><li><p>Once the nucleus has divided into two genetically identical nuclei, the <b>whole cell divides </b>and one nucleus moves into each cell to <b>create two genetically identical daughter cells</b></p></li><li><p>In animal cells, cytokinesis involves <b>constriction of the cytoplasm</b> between the two nuclei and in plant cells a new cell wall is formed</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="col-12"><div class="Wrapper_wrapper__raXe4 Card_card__7rJy4 bg-body-secondary

different phases. Don’t forget, interphase is itself made up of three distinct stages (G<sub>1</sub>, S and G<sub>2</sub>) and you need to know what happens during each of these.</p><p>For example, an exam question might ask you to identify the stage of the cell cycle during which a cell would be producing the most mRNA molecules and explain why. The correct answer would be the G<sub>1</sub> phase, as this is when protein synthesis is occurring and the production of mRNA occurs during transcription (the first part of protein synthesis).</p></div></div></div></div>
