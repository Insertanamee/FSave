or <b>transcription factors</b> can be affected in response to <b>environmental stimuli</b> such as light, and chemicals including drugs and hormones</p></li><li><p>For example, enzymes are activated in response to ultraviolet radiation and increase the expression of melanin-producing genes (and therefore production of melanin), leading to skin pigmentation</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Epigenetics is the control of gene expression by factors other than an individual’s DNA sequence</p><ul><li><p>Epigenetics involves the <b>switching-on</b> and <b>switching-off</b> of genes, but <b>without</b> changing the actual genetic code</p></li></ul></li><li><p>In eukaryotic cells, nuclear DNA is <b>wrapped</b> around <b>proteins</b> called <b>histones</b> to form <b>chromatin</b></p></li><li><p>Chromatin can be <b>chemically modified </b>in different ways to alter gene expression, including:</p><ul><li><p><b>Methylation of DNA</b> (chemical addition of -CH<sub>3</sub> groups)</p></li><li><p><b>Histone modification</b> via <b>acetylation</b> of amino acid tails</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Such modifications are called epigenetic tags and collectively, all the epigenetic tags in an organism is called the <b>epigenome</b></p></li><li><p>The epigenome can undergo changes due to environmental factors</p><ul><li><p>Smoking, stress, exercise and diet can cause epigenetic changes</p></li><li><p>Internal signalling from the body's own cells can also cause modifications to occur</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Epigenetic modification is <b>independent </b>(i.e. DNA methylation or histone modification in one area is <b>not linked</b> to modification in another)</p></li><li><p>The chemical modification of histones and DNA controls <b>how tightly the DNA is wound</b> around them as the <b>intermolecular bonding between the histones and DNA changes</b></p><ul><li><p>If the DNA is wound <b>more tightly </b>in a certain area, the genes on this section of DNA are '<b>switched off</b>' as the gene and promoter regions are more <b>hidden from transcription factors and RNA polymerase</b></p></li></ul></li><li><p>The modification of histones is <b>reversible</b> and therefore can be different in different cell types and can vary with age</p></li></ul><div class="mb-5" data-type="image"><img alt="Chromatin and histone proteins"
