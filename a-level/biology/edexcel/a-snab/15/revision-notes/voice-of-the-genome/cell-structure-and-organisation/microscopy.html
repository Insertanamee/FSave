dehydration </b>of tissue</p><ul><li><p>The thin layers of material placed on slides can <b>dry up rapidly</b></p></li><li><p>Adding a drop of water to the specimen beneath the coverslip can prevent the cells from being damaged by dehydration</p></li></ul></li><li><p><b>Unclear or blurry images</b></p><ul><li><p>Switch to the lower power objective lens and try using the <b>coarse focus </b>to get a clearer image</p></li><li><p>Consider whether the specimen sample is<b> thin enough</b> for light to pass through to see the structures clearly</p></li><li><p>There could be <b>cross-contamination</b> with foreign cells or bodies</p></li></ul></li></ul><h4 id="limitations">Limitations</h4><ul><li><p>The size of cells or structures of tissues may appear inconsistent in different specimen slides</p><ul><li><p>Cell structures are 3D and the different tissue samples will have been <b>cut at different planes </b>resulting in this inconsistencies when viewed on a 2D slide</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Optical microscopes do not have the same magnification power as other types of microscopes and so there are some structures that cannot be seen</p></li><li><p>The

under a microscope sometimes need to be <b>stained</b>, as the cytoplasm and other cell structures may be <b>transparent</b> or <b>difficult to distinguish</b></p><ul><li><p>Note that most of the colours seen in<b> </b>images taken using a light microscope are the result of added stains</p><ul><li><p>Chloroplasts are the exception to this; they show up green, which is their natural colour</p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p>The <b>type of stain</b> used is dependent on what type of specimen is being prepared and what the researcher wants to observe within the specimen</p><ul><li><p><b>Different molecules absorb different dyes</b> depending on their chemical nature</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Specimens or sections are sometimes stained with <b>multiple dyes</b> to ensure that several <b>different tissues</b> within the specimen show up; this is known as <b>differential staining</b></p></li><li><p>Some common stains include</p><ul><li><p>Methylene
