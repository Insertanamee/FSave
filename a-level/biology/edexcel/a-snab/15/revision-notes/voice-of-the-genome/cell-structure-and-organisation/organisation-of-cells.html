become <b>specialised</b> for <b>specific functions, </b>e.g.</p><ul><li><p>Epithelial cells in the small intestine are specialised to absorb food efficiently</p></li><li><p>Red blood cells are specialised to transport oxygen</p></li><li><p>Xylem cells in plants are specialised to allow the transport of water around a plant</p></li></ul></li><li><p>In multicellular organisms specialised cells of the <b>same type</b> group <b>together</b> to form <b>tissues</b></p><ul><li><p>A tissue is <b>a group of cells that work together to perform a</b> <b>particular function</b>, e.g.</p><ul><li><p>Epithelial cells group together to form epithelial tissue the function of which, in the small intestine, is to absorb food</p></li><li><p>Muscle cells group together to form muscle tissue, the function of which is to contract in order to move parts of the body</p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p>Different tissues can <b>group together </b>to form <b>organs</b></p><ul><li><p>An organ is <b>a group of tissues working together to perform a particular function</b>, e.g.</p><ul><li><p>Many different tissues, including cardiac muscle tissue, blood vessel tissues and connective tissue, group together to form the <b>heart</b>, enabling it to function to pump blood around the body</p></li><li><p>Tissues including palisade mesophyll, spongy mesophyll, and vascular tissue, group together in plants to form <b>leaves</b>, enabling them to perform photosynthesis effectively</p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p>Different organs <b>work together</b> to form <b>organ systems</b></p><ul><li><p>An organ system is <b>a group of organs working together to perform a particular function</b>, e.g.</p><ul><li><p>The heart and blood vessels work together to form the <b>circulatory system</b>, the job of which is to allow blood to circulate around the body</p></li><li><p>The stomach, pancreas, small intestine, and large intestine work together to form the <b>digestive system</b>, the job of which is to digest food and absorb nutrients</p></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p class="text-center"><b>Levels of Organisation Table</b></p><div class="mb-5"
