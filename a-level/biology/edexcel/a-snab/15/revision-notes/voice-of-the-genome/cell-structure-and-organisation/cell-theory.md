## Cell Theory

* Until microscopes became powerful enough to view individual cells, no-one knew for certain what living organisms were made from
* A scientist called **Robert Hooke** is thought to be the **first person to view cells,**using the term 'cell' to describe these newly discovered structures
* Matthias **Schleiden** and Theodor **Schwann** were two other scientists who studied animal and plant cells

  + In 1837 they came up with the idea that **all living organisms are made of cells**
  + This idea is known as **‘cell theory’**
  + The cell theory is a **unifying concept** in biology, meaning that it is **universally accepted**
* Cell theory includes **three main ideas**

  + **All living organisms** are made up of **one or more cells**
  + Cells are the **basic functional unit** in living organisms
  + **New cells** are produced from **pre-existing cells**

* The cells of all living organisms share some **common features**

  + Cell surface membrane
  + Cytoplasm
  + DNA
  + Ribosomes
* Beyond these common features different cell types contain **different structural elements** and combinations of organelles, e.g.

  + Prokaryotic cells have no internal membranes and smaller ribosomes
  + Eukaryotic cells have several internal membrane-bound organelles and larger ribosomes
* When examined under a **microscope** it is possible to see the **ultrastructure** of different cell types

  + Cell ultrastructure refers to the internal structures of the cell
