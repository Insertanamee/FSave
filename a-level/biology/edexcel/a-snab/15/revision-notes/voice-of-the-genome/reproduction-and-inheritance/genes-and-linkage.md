## Locations of Genes on a Chromosome

* Every **chromosome** consists of a long DNA molecule that contains several hundred or even thousands of **different genes** coding for different proteins

  + A length of DNA that codes for a single polypeptide or protein is called a gene
* The position of a gene on a chromosome is known as its **locus** (plural: loci)

  + Through experiments and genetic mapping techniques, scientists have been able to work out the **specific physical locations** of the genes on different chromosomes
  + Each gene occupies a **specific locus** so that the gene for a particular characteristic is always found at the **same position** on a particular chromosome
* Each gene can exist in two or more different forms called **alleles**
* Different alleles of a gene have slightly different nucleotide sequences but they still occupy the **same position** (locus) on the chromosome

## Autosomal Linkage

* As its name implies, autosomal linkage only occurs on the **autosomes** (any chromosome that isnâ€™t a sex chromosome)
* **Two or more genes** on the **same** autosome **do not assort independently** during **meiosis**
* Instead, these genes are **linked** and they **stay together** in the original parental combination
* These linked genes are passed on to offspring **all togethe**r (through the gametes)

## Sex Linkage

* There are two sex chromosomes: **X** and **Y**
* Females have two copies of the X chromosome (**XX**), whereas males have one X chromosome and one shorter Y chromosome (**XY**)
* Some genes are only present on **one** sex chromosome and **not the other**
* As the inheritance of these genes is dependent on the sex of the individual they are known as **sex-linked genes**

  + **Most often** sex-linked genes are found on the **longer** **X chromosome**
* If the gene is on the X chromosome, males (XY) will only have one copy of the gene, whereas females (XX) will have two

  + Because males only have one X chromosome, they are **much more likely to show sex-linked recessive conditions** (such as red-green colour blindness and haemophilia)
  + Females, having two copies of the X chromosome, are likely to inherit one dominant allele that **masks the effect of the recessive allele**
