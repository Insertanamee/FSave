data-type="specPoint"><h2 id="studying-the-brain">Studying the Brain</h2><ul><li><p>Our understanding of brain structure and function is limited </p><ul><li><p>The brain is incredibly<b> complex</b> and <b>very delicate</b></p></li><li><p>Different regions work together to bring about brain function so can’t be studied in <b>isolation</b></p></li></ul></li><li><p>It is therefore extremely difficult for neuroscientists to study the brain and find out how it works</p></li><li><p>Specialised <b>scanners</b> and techniques can be used to study the brain without having to resort to <b>surgical intervention</b></p></li></ul><h4 id="computerised-tomography">Computerised Tomography</h4><ul><li><p><b>Computerised tomography</b>, or <b>CT</b>, scans produce cross-section images of the brain using <b>x-ray radiation</b></p><ul><li><p>A beam of x-rays are aimed at a patient from all angles around the body </p></li><li><p>Digital x-ray detectors are used to pick up the x-rays as they exit the patient's body</p></li><li><p>Denser tissue absorbs more of the x-ray radiation so shows up as a lighter region on a scan</p></li></ul></li><li><p>A scan produced in this way shows <b>physical structures</b> of the brain and allows visualisation of any tissue damage</p><ul><li><p>E.g. blood is less dense than brain tissue so a CT scan can be used to locate damaged blood vessels and areas of bleeding after a patient has had a stroke</p></li></ul></li><li><p>The scans <b>don't directly show the functions</b> of the regions of the brain but it is possible to link visible symptoms with the location of any tissue damage </p><ul><li><p>This can allow neurologists to work out which regions of the brain are responsible for which functions</p></li></ul></li><li><p>CT scans are not recommended for <b>pregnant patients or children</b> due to the risks of exposure to the X-ray radiation, which is given at a <b>higher level</b> than in a normal X-ray</p><ul><li><p>The risk of damage from such scans is still very low</p></li></ul></li></ul><h4 id="magnetic-resonance-imaging">Magnetic Resonance Imaging</h4><ul><li><p><b>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</b>, or <b>MRI</b>, uses a combination of a <b>magnetic field and radio waves</b> to generate images through the body</p><ul><li><p>The patient being scanned must remain very still while inside a large magnet</p></li></ul></li><li><p><b>Soft tissues</b> can be seen clearly using MRI, and images produced are at a <b>higher resolution</b> than those produced from CT scanning</p></li><li><p>As with CT scanning, MRI is useful for <b>identifying areas of abnormal or damaged tissue</b>, but only enables brain function to be analysed by<b> linking damage on a scan with visible symptoms</b> in a patient</p></li><li><p>MRI is especially useful for <b>tumour diagnosis</b> as tumours show up clearly in images generated in this way</p><ul><li><p>MRI scans can therefore be used to <b>identify and locate tumours</b> in the brain</p></li></ul></li><li><p>MRI scans are <b>considerably more expensive</b> to carry out than CT scans but <b>do not carry the risk associated with the use of potentially harmful x-rays</b></p><ul><li><p>MRI scans are often the imaging method of choice during long-term therapies</p></li></ul></li><li><p>The magnetic field of an MRI scanner can <b>interfere with medical devices</b> such as pacemakers and insulin pumps, so patients with such devices cannot have MRI scans</p></li></ul><h4 id="functional-mri">Functional MRI</h4><ul><li><p><b>Functional MRI</b>, or <b>fMRI</b>, functions in a similar way to MRI, making use of a magnetic field and radio waves to generate images of brain structure</p></li><li><p>The difference between MRI and fMRI is that fMRI scans allow <b>brain function to be studied in real time</b></p><ul><li><p>fMRI scans show the <b>location of oxygenated blood</b> in the brain, therefore indicating <b>which brain regions are active</b> at any one time</p><ul><li><p>The scanner measures the <b>ratio of oxygenated to deoxygenated</b> <span class="popovers" data-content="This is the protein in red blood cells, which combines with oxygen to make oxyhaemoglobin in order to transport the oxygen to respiring cells." data-title="Haemoglobin" data-toggle="popover" data-type="definition">haemoglobin</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p>Patients can be asked to carry out particular actions, answer questions, or think about a specific topic while inside a scanner and the <b>change in blood flow to regions of the brain can be assessed</b></p><ul><li><p>The region of the brain associated with the activity or thought will 'light up' in the scanner </p></li><li><p>This can be used in medical diagnosis e.g. searching for the cause of seizures, or in psychology research</p></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h4 id="positron-emission-tomography">Positron Emission Tomography</h4><ul><li><p>PET scans use <b>radioactive tracers</b> which collect in areas where there is <b>increased</b> <b>blood flow,</b> <span class="popovers" data-content="All of the chemical reactions that happen in a cell or organism to keep it alive." data-title="Metabolic reactions" data-toggle="popover" data-type="definition">metabolism</span>, or <span class="popovers" data-content="A chemical which is secreted by a neurone within the nervous system to stimulate a target cell" data-title="Neurotransmitter" data-toggle="popover" data-type="definition">neurotransmitter</span> activity</p><ul><li><p>The tracer is introduced to the blood in advance of the scan so that it can be detected by the scanner</p></li><li><p>E.g. a radioactive tracer might be <b>radioactively labelled glucose</b>; glucose will be transported in the blood and will be present in high concentrations in metabolically active areas of the brain</p></li></ul></li><li><p>The scanner can detect areas of <b>high radioactivity</b>, and so the movement of the tracer through the body and any accumulation of tracer in the brain can be seen</p></li><li><p>The amount of radioactive tracer present in a brain region can<b> indicate whether that region is active or inactive</b></p><ul><li><p>This has been useful in building an understanding of specific diseases such as Alzheimer's where brain activity in certain regions decreases</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Neurologists can use the images to study the <b>structure</b> and <b>function</b> of the brain in <b>real time</b> </p></li></ul><div class="mb-5" data-type="image"><img alt="types-of-brain-scan" class="ContentBlock_figure__6whpf"
