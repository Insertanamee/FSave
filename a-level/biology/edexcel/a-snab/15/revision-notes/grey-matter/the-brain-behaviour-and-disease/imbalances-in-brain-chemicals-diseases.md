## Imbalances in Brain Chemicals Leading to Diseases

* **Neurotransmitters** are chemicals that transmit nerve impulses across synapses
* Some disorders and diseases are linked to an **imbalance of neurotransmitters in the brain**
* Two examples are

  + **Parkinson's Disease**
  + **Depression**

#### Parkinson's disease

* **Parkinson's disease** is a brain disorder that affects the **co-ordination of movement**, caused by the **loss of neurones** in some parts of the brain
* Symptoms include

  + A tremor to the specific parts of the body
  + Slow movement
  + Stiff and inflexible muscles
  + Difficulties with balance
  + Changes to speech
* The lost neurones normally produce the neurotransmitter **dopamine**

  + Dopamine is involved in **muscle control**
* Individuals that suffer from Parkinson's disease produce **insufficient amounts** of dopamine due to the loss of dopamine-producing neurones

  + **Less dopamine is released** into the synaptic cleft meaning less is able to bind with receptors on the postsynaptic membrane
  + **Fewer sodium channels on the membrane are opened** so depolarisation of the postsynaptic neurone does not occur
  + This leads to **fewer** action potentials which creates the symptoms such as tremors and slow movement
* Different types of **drugs** can be used to treat this disease

  + Dopamine **agonists**

    - Produce the same effect as dopamine by binding to and activating the dopamine receptors on the postsynaptic membrane
  + Dopamine **precursors**

    - These are chemicals that can be converted into dopamine in the neurones
    - E.g. L-dopa
  + Enzyme inhibitors

    - Monoamine oxidase B (MAOB) inhibitors inhibit the activity of enzymes that would normally break down dopamine in the synaptic cleft, raising levels of dopamine present in the brain
* Research into other treatments for Parkinson's disease is currently ongoing, with some promising future possibilities in the areas of

  + **Gene therapy**

    - This would involve the addition of genes to the affected cells in the brain to either increase dopamine production or prevent the destruction of dopamine-producing cells
  + **Stem cell therapy**

    - Stem cells could be used to replace the lost dopamine-producing cells in the brain

#### Depression

* Low levels of the neurotransmitter **serotonin** have been **linked to depression**

  + Serotonin transmits nerve impulses through the **areas of the brain that control mood**
  + Low levels of serotonin increase episodes of depression
* Other brain chemicals linked to depression include **noradrenaline** and **dopamine**
* Some drugs that have been developed for the treatment of depression, known as antidepressants, work by **increasing the levels of relevant neurotransmitters** in the brain

  + SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) are a class of antidepressant that **prevent the uptake of serotonin at synapses;** this increases the overall levels of serotonin in the brain
  + TCAs (tricyclic antidepressants) **increase levels of both serotonin and noradrenaline** in the brain
  + MAOB inhibitors **inhibit enzymes that would otherwise break down neurotransmitters** in the synaptic clefts in the brain
