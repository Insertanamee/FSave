has taken place <b>fewer calcium ions</b> move into the presynaptic neurone on arrival of a nerve impulse</p></li><li><p>As a result, <b>less neurotransmitter</b> is released and <b>an action potential is less likely </b>to be generated in the postsynaptic neurone</p><ul><li><p>Fewer molecules of neurotransmitter bind to receptors on the postsynaptic membrane</p></li><li><p>Fewer sodium ion channels open</p></li><li><p>Fewer sodium ions move into the axon and the charge inside the axon remains negative</p></li><li><p>Threshold potential is not reached</p></li></ul></li><li><p>The
