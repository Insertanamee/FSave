## Nature vs Nurture in Brain Development

* **Brain development** refers to the **growth** of the brain and the formation of connections between neurones, or **neural pathways**
* There are a number of **factors that can be measured** to determine brain development

  + Brain size
  + Number of neurones
  + The level at which the brain is functioning
* Brain development is influenced by both **genetic** and **environmental factors**

  + The impact of genetic factors can be referred to as the impact of '**nature**' on development while the impact of environmental factors can be referred to that of '**nurture**'
* It is **very difficult** to determine which of **nature or nurture** has the greatest influence on brain development

  + The **genes and environment** of an organism **interact** with each other and it is difficult to separate out the impacts of each

    - A scientist would have to **completely remove** the influence of one of the factors in order to investigate the other; an almost impossible task!
  + There are **many different** genes and environmental factors to investigate

#### Methods for investigating the effects of nature & nurture

* **Animal experiments**

  + Scientists study the effects that **different environments** have on the brain development of individuals of the **same species**

    - The **environment in which animals live can be manipulated** to allow the investigation of the impact of environment on brain development

      * Animals of the same species would have **similar genes**, therefore making it **more likely** that differences in brain development would be due to the changed **environmental factors**
  + Genetic modification can be used to switch off the function of a certain gene; raising genetically altered animals alongside unaltered animals in a similar environment allows the **impact of genetic factors to be studied**

    - Any differences observed in the brain development of the two groups would most likely be due to **genetic factors**
    - This type of genetic engineering is considered ethical in animals such as mice, but cannot be carried out in humans

* **Twin studies**

  + **Identical twins** are **genetically identical** to each other so if they are raised in **different environments** then any differences in brain development would be due to **nurture**, while **similarities** would be due to **nature**

    - E.g. the **IQ scores** of identical twins are very similar which implies that nature plays an important role in intelligence
  + When identical twins are raised together **their environments will be very similar**, so it can be very difficult to distinguish between the impacts of nature and nurture

    - Scientists will often use **non-identical twins** raised in a similar environment as a **control group** when studying identical twins raised together in the same environment

      * Non-identical twins are genetically different
    - This cancels out the effect of the environment, meaning any **observable difference** in brain development between the identical and non-identical twins will be likely due to **nature**

      * Traits that are more common in identical twins than non-identical twins are likely to be **determined by largely genetic factors**
      * Traits thatshow little difference between the pairs of twins are likely to be **determined by largely environmental factors**

* **Cross-cultural studies**

  + Different cultures provide **different environmental influences** on the brain development of children
  + Scientists can study the effect of this by comparing large groups of children of a similar age from different cultural backgrounds
  + Any **differences** in brain development are **more likely** to be due to **nurture**, whereas any **similarities** will more likely be due to **nature**

* **Newborn studies**

  + The environment outside the womb would not have impacted the brain development of a newborn baby
  + The **level of brain development** that babies are born with are therefore more likely due to **nature** than nurture

    - E.g. babies are born with a variety of **basic abilities** (e.g. crying, feeding, recognising faces) which suggests that **nature** plays an important role in the development of these abilities
    - They do not have the ability to **speak** which implies that **nurture** plays an important role

* **Brain damage studies**

  + Brain damage in adults cannot be easily repaired as the brain is fully developed, however, since a child's brain is still developing, they provide an opportunity for scientists to study the **effects of brain damage on development**
  + Scientists can choose a **particular characteristic** and then compare the development of that trait in children born with and without brain damage

    - If children born with brain damage **show the development** of that characteristic, then it is more likely due to **nurture** than nature

      * E.g. young children with brain damage to the area associated with **language** show a delay in language milestones when compared to children without brain damage, but they catch up to the level of children without brain damage by the age of 5, suggesting that **nurture** plays an important role in language development
    - If the characteristic **doesn't develop** in brain damaged children, it is more likely to be due to **nature**
