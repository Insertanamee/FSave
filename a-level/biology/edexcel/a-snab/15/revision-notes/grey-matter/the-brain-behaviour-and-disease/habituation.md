## Habituation

* Animals must **respond to changes** in their **external** and **internal** environments in order to survive

  + Changes in the environment, or **stimuli**(singular**stimulus**) are detected by specialised **receptor cells**
  + Receptor cells send **signals** via either the**nervous system**or the **hormonal system** to the body's co-ordination centres in the**brain** or **spinal cord**
  + Signals are then sent on to the parts of the body which respond, known as the **effectors**
* The process of detecting and responding to stimuli **requires energy**, so it is important that animals don't **waste energy responding to non-threatening stimuli**

  + Animals need to conserve energy for essential processes that increase their survival chances
* If a stimulus is **repeated many times** with **no negative outcome,** then an animal will learn **not to respond to it**; this process is known as **habituation**

  + An animal that doesn't respond to a stimulus is said to be **habituated** to that stimulus
* Examples of habituation include

  + Humans no longer noticing a new smell or sound after a period of exposure
  + Wild animals losing their fear of humans after regular non-harmful contact
  + Animals learning not to be alarmed by the presence of non-predatory species
* If a stimulus to which an animal has become habituated **changes,** then the nervous system will respond to it again

  + E.g. a constant low-level sound that suddenly becomes louder

#### The process of habituation

* Animals **become habituated** due to **changes in the transmission of nerve impulses** from one neurone to the next

  + Nerve impulses are transmitted across synapses by the diffusion of **chemical neurotransmitters**
  + Neurotransmitters are released at the presynaptic membrane in response to an **influx of calcium ions**
* When habituation has taken place **fewer calcium ions** move into the presynaptic neurone on arrival of a nerve impulse
* As a result, **less neurotransmitter** is released and **an action potential is less likely** to be generated in the postsynaptic neurone

  + Fewer molecules of neurotransmitter bind to receptors on the postsynaptic membrane
  + Fewer sodium ion channels open
  + Fewer sodium ions move into the axon and the charge inside the axon remains negative
  + Threshold potential is not reached
* The nerve impulse therefore **does not reach the effector** organ and the animal **does not respond** to the stimulus

## Practical: Investigating Habituation to a Stimulus

* Habituation to a stimulus can be studied by **measuring the changes in an animal's response to a non-harmful stimulus** e.g.

  + Snails often respond to a stimulus by **withdrawing into their shell**, waiting to **emerge again** until the harmful stimulus is likely to be gone
  + As snails become habituated to a stimulus the **time taken for them to re-emerge** from their shells after a stimulus **gets shorter**

#### Apparatus

* Snail
* A soft object with which to provide a stimulus e.g. a damp cotton bud or a blade of grass
* Stopwatch

#### Method

1. Place a snail on a clean, flat surface and give it time to emerge from its shell

   * The **same surface** should be used throughout the experiment
   * Ensure that **humidity remains the same** throughout as snails will withdraw in a dry environment
2. Gently brush the snail's head with a damp cotton bud or blade of grass

   * It is expected that the snail will withdraw into its shell in response to the touch
3. Start the stopwatch and measure the time taken until the snail re-emerges from the shell and fully extends its eye-stalks again
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 10-15 times, recording the time taken until full re-emergence each time

   * Ensure that the **same soft object** is used throughout and that the **location of the touch on the snail's body remains the same**
   * Waiting for full extension of the eye stalks ensures that the **same end-point** is used each time
5. Plot a graph of touch number against time taken for full re-emergence

   * The graph would be expected to show a **gradual decrease in the time taken for full re-emergence** as the snail becomes habituated to the stimulus

* Note that snails are living organisms and so **welfare considerations** should be taken into account when using them for experimental purposes

  + Snails should be **returned to a suitable environment** that replicates their natural habitat at the end of the experiment

    - If snails were taken from a garden or the school grounds then they should be returned to the **exact location from which they were removed**
  + Any handling and transfer of snails should be carried out **gently and quickly**
  + Snails should not be exposed to **high temperatures** or an overly **dry environment**
