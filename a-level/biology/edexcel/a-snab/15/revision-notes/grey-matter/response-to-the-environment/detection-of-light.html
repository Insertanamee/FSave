<b>diffuse </b>back down this concentration gradient into the rod cell via <b>sodium channels</b></p><ul><li><p>Sodium channels are also known as <b>cation channels</b> because they allow the movement of positively charged ions</p></li></ul></li><li><p>At this stage there is little difference in charge between the outside and inside of the rod cell, and the cell is said to be <b>depolarised</b></p><ul><li><p>In reality the inside of the rod cell is <b>slightly negative</b> in comparison to the outside</p></li></ul></li><li><p>The depolarised rod cell <b>releases neurotransmitters</b> which diffuse across a synapse to a <b>bipolar neurone</b></p></li><li><p>Rather than initiating an action potential in the bipolar neurone <b>this neurotransmitter inhibits the

<b>more negative</b> potential difference across it than the resting -70 mV</p></li></ul></li><li><p>The hyperpolarised rod cell <b>stops releasing an inhibitory neurotransmitter</b>, so the generation of an action potential in the neighbouring bipolar neurone is <b>no longer inhibited</b></p></li><li><p>An <b>action potential</b> is generated in the bipolar neurone attached to the rod
