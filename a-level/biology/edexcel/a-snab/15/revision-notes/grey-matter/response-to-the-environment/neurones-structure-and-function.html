impulses</b> around the body</p></li><li><p>A bundle of neurones is known as a <b>nerve</b></p></li><li><p>There are different types of neurones, but the following features are found in all types</p><ul><li><p>A <b>long fibre</b> known as an <b>axon</b></p></li><li><p>A <b>cell body</b> that contains the <b>nucleus</b> and other cellular structures</p></li><li><p>The end of the axon, known as the <b>axon terminal,</b> has many nerve endings</p><ul><li><p>The nerve endings at the axon terminals allow neurones to <b>connect</b> to and<b> receive impulses from</b> other <b>neurones</b>, forming a <b>network</b> for easy <b>communication</b></p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p>Some neurones are<b> myelinated</b>, meaning that their axon is <b>insulated</b> by a fatty layer known as the <b>myelin sheath</b> </p><ul><li><p>The myelin sheath is made up of specialised cells known as <b>Schwann cells </b>which wrap themselves around the axon</p></li><li><p>There are <b>uninsulated gaps</b> between the Schwann cells known as the <b>nodes of Ranvier</b></p></li><li><p>Electrical impulses in myelinated cells do not travel down the whole axon, but jump from one <b>node</b> to the next, speeding up impulse transmission</p></li></ul></li><li><p>In<b> non-myelinated neurones</b> the axon is not insulated by Schwann cells</p><ul><li><p>The impulse travels more slowly as it moves through the entire length of the axon</p></li></ul></li></ul><div class="mb-5" data-type="image"><img alt="The structure of a myelinated neurone"
