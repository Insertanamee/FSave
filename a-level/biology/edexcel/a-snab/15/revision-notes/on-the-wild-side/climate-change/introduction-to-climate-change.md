## Introduction to Climate Change

* The termÂ **climate** refers to the **weather conditions** in a region over a **long period of time** i.e. several decades
* When the weather conditions in a region change significantly over a long period of time, this is **climate change**
* Changes to the climate have **occurred frequently throughout Earth's history** due to changes in factors such as atmospheric gas concentrations and volcanic activity, but climate changes that have occurred **since the mid-1800s** are thought to be the result of **human activities**

  + The term climate change is most often used today to refer to **global warming** that is occurring as a result of human activities
* Changes to **global climate patterns** result in alterations to **local weather patterns** e.g. rainfall and temperatures
