can interbreed and produce fertile offspring." data-title="Species" data-toggle="popover" data-type="definition">Species</span> are adapted, or well-suited, to life in a particular habitat</p></li><li><p>A habitat can be defined as <b>the place where an organism lives</b></p><ul><li><p>A habitat can be <b>large,</b> e.g. a desert, or <b>small,</b> e.g. an individual tree</p><ul><li><p>Small habitats are sometimes referred to as <b>microhabitats</b></p></li></ul></li><li><p>Some species are habitat <b>specialists,</b> meaning that they can only survive in a very specific type of habitat, while others are <b>generalists</b> and can survive in a range of habitats</p><ul><li><p>Generalists are more likely to be able to invade and take over a new habitat; such species are known as invasive species </p><ul><li><p>Humans sometime release new species into a habitat, either accidentally or on purpose; these species can disrupt the normal species interactions in a habitat and cause serious problems</p></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h4 id="population">Population</h4><ul><li><p>When a species is found in a habitat, that habitat is said to support a <b>population</b> </p></li><li><p>A population can be defined as <b>all of the individuals of one species living in a habitat</b></p><ul><li><p>The size of a population can be measured; this is the <b>abundance</b> of a species in a habitat</p></li><li><p>The exact location of a population within a habitat is a species' <b>distribution</b> within that habitat</p></li></ul></li></ul><h4 id="community">Community</h4><ul><li><p>Species do not exist by themselves in their own isolated environment; they <b>interact</b> with <b>other species</b>, forming <b>communities</b></p></li><li><p>A community can be defined as <b>multiple populations living and interacting in the same area</b></p><ul><li><p>For example, a garden pond <b>community</b> is made up of populations of fish, frogs, newts, pond snails, damselflies and dragonflies and their larvae, pondweed, water lilies, and all other populations living in the pond</p></li></ul></li></ul><h4 id="ecosystem">Ecosystem</h4><ul><li><p>Communities interact with the <b>non-living components</b> of the <b>habitat </b>they live in, forming <b>ecosystems</b></p></li><li><p>An ecosystem can be defined as <b>a community and its interactions with the non-living parts of its habitat</b></p><ul><li><p>There is a<b> </b>flow of energy<b> </b>within an ecosystem and nutrients within it are recycled</p></li><li><p>There are both <span class="popovers" data-content="Concerned with the living organisms in the environment." data-title="Biotic Factors" data-toggle="popover"

data-type="definition">abiotic</span><b> components</b> within an ecosystem</p></li><li><p>Ecosystems <b>vary greatly in size and scale</b></p><ul><li><p>A small pond in a back garden and the open ocean could both be described as ecosystems</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Ecosystems <b>vary in complexity</b></p><ul><li><p>A desert is a relatively simple ecosystem</p></li><li><p>A tropical rainforest is a very complex ecosystem</p></li></ul></li><li><p>No ecosystem is completely self-contained as organisms from one ecosystem can often move to another</p><ul><li><p>E.g. birds and aquatic animals are able to migrate long distances to feed from multiple ecosystems</p></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><div class="mb-5" data-type="image"><img alt="Levels of Organisation in an Ecosystem"
