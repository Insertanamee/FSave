## Chloroplasts: Structure & Function

* Chloroplasts are the organelles in plant cells where **photosynthesis**occurs
* Each chloroplast is surrounded by a **double-membrane** known as the **chloroplast envelope**

  + Each of the envelope membranes is a phospholipid bilayer
* Chloroplasts are filled with a **cytoplasm-like** fluid known as the **stroma**

  + The stroma contains **enzymes** and **sugars**, as well as **ribosomes** and **chloroplast DNA**
  + If the chloroplast has been photosynthesising there may be **starch grains** or **lipid droplets** in the stroma
* A **separate system of membranes** is found in the stroma

  + This membrane system consists of a series of flattened fluid-filled sacs known as **thylakoids**, each surrounded by a **thylakoid membrane**
  + Thylakoids stack up to form structures known as **grana** (singular granum)
  + Grana are connected by membranous channels called **lamellae** (singular lamella), which ensure the stacks of sacs are connected but distanced from each other
* Several components that are essential for photosynthesis are **embedded in the thylakoid membranes**

  + **ATP synthase enzymes**
  + Proteins called **photosystems** contain **photosynthetic pigments** such as chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and carotene

***Chloroplasts are the site of photosynthesis***

#### Chloroplast structure is related to function

* **Chloroplast envelope**

  + The double membrane **encloses the chloroplast**, keeping all of the components needed for photosynthesis close to each other
  + The transport proteins present in the inner membrane controlthe flow of molecules between the stroma and cytoplasm
* **Stroma**

  + The gel-like fluid contains **enzymes**that catalyse the reactions of photosynthesis
* **DNA**

  + The chloroplast DNA contains **genes** that code for some of the proteins used in photosynthesis
* **Ribosomes**

  + Ribosomes enable the translation**of proteins**coded by the chloroplast DNA
* **Thylakoid membrane**

  + There is a space between the two membranes of this double membrane known as the **thylakoid space**, in which conditions can differ from the stroma e.g. a **proton gradient** can be established between the thylakoid space and the stroma
  + The space has a very small volume so a proton gradient can develop very **quickly**
* **Grana**

  + The grana create a **large surface area,** maximising the number of photosystems and allowing **maximum**light absorption
  + Grana also provide **more membrane area** for proteins such as electron carriers and ATP synthase enzymes, which together enable the **production of ATP**
* **Photosystems**

  + There are two types of photosystem; **photosystem I** and **photosystem II**, containing **different combinations of photosynthetic pigments** such as chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and carotene
  + Each photosystem absorbs **light of a different wavelength**, maximising light absorption e.g. photosystem I absorbs light at a wavelength of 700 nm while photosystem II absorbs light at a wavelength of 680 nm
