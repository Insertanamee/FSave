results are statistically significant</b></p></li><li><p>Some studies need to have a<b> control </b>with which to compare the results</p><ul><li><p>E.g. when testing a drug to treat heart disease, a control group that is not given the drug should be included in the study to ensure that any effect shown is due to the drug and not any other factor</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Studies should be <b>repeated</b>, or there should be <b>many studies that show the same result</b>, before conclusions can be drawn</p></li><li><p>The study should be designed to <b>control any variable that is not
