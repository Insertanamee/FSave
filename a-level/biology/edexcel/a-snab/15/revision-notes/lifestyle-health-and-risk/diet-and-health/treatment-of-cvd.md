## Treatment of CVD

* While reducing the risk factors and lowering the risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the best option, CVD is still very common and treatment options are needed
* There are a number of different **treatment options** for cardiovascular disease, many of which involve taking **medication**
* Types of medication for the treatment of CVD include

  + Antihypertensives
  + Statins
  + Anticoagulants
  + Platelet inhibitors

#### Antihypertensives

* These drugs work by **lowering blood pressure**

  + High blood pressure is also known as **hypertension**
* Lowering blood pressure **reduces the risk of arterial endothelial damage** and therefore reduces the risk of atheromas and thrombosis
* **Beta blockers,** **vasodilators** and **diuretics** act as antihypertensives

  + Beta blockers prevent increases in heart rate
  + Vasodilators increase the diameter of the blood vessels
  + Diuretics reduce blood volume by decreasing the amount of sodium reabsorbed into the blood by the kidneys, therefore decreasing the volume of water reabsorbed into the blood

#### Statins

* These drugs work by **lowering blood cholesterol**

  + They block an enzyme in the liver which is needed to make cholesterol
* This **lowers the LDL concentration** in the blood therefore reducing the risk of atheroma formation

  + LDLs are sometimes known as 'bad' cholesterol; at high levels they increase the risk of atheromas forming

#### Anticoagulants

* These drugs **reduce blood clotting**

  + Blood clotting can be referred to as blood coagulation
* Reduced formation of blood clots **decreases the likelihood of thrombosis** and therefore reduces the risk of blood vessels being blocked by blood clots

#### Platelet inhibitors

* These are also substances which **reduce blood clotting**

  + Platelet inhibitors are a type of anticoagulant
* They prevent the clumping together of **platelets,** so preventing the formation of blood clots
* **Aspirin** is an example of a platelet inhibitor
