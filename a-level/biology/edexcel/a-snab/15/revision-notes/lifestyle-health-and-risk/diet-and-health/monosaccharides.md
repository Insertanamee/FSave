## Monosaccharides: Structure

* **Carbohydrates** are one of the main carbon-based compounds in living organisms
* All molecules in this group contain **C, H and O**

  + Carbon atoms are key to the structure of organic compounds because

    - Each carbon atom can form **covalent bonds**; this makes the compounds very stable

      * Covalent bonds are so strong they require a large input of energy to break them
    - Carbon atoms can form covalent bonds with oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur
    - Carbon atoms can bond to form straight chains, branched chains, or rings
* Carbon compounds can form small, single subunits, or **monomers,** that bond with many repeating subunits to form large molecules, or **polymers**

  + This is a process called **polymerisation**
* The three types of carbohydrates are **monosaccharides**, **disaccharides,** and **polysaccharides**

#### Monosaccharides

* Monosaccharides are the **monomers** of carbohydrate; they can join together to make carbohydrate polymers

  + Monosaccharides are simple carbohydrates
  + Monosaccharides are **sugars**
* There are different types of monosaccharide formed from molecules with varying numbers of carbon (C) atoms, for example

  + **Triose** (3C) eg. glyceraldehyde
  + **Pentose** (5C) eg. ribose
  + **Hexose** (6C) eg. glucose
* **Glucose** is a well known example of a monosaccharide

  + Glucose is a **hexose sugar**
  + The six carbons that make up glucose form a **ring structure**

    - Carbons 1-5 form a ring, while carbon 6 sticks out above the ring
* Glucose comes in two forms; **alpha** (![alpha](data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%22%20xmlns%3Awrs%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wiris.com%2Fxml%2Fmathml-extension%22%20height%3D%2222%22%20width%3D%2211%22%20wrs%3Abaseline%3D%2216%22%3E%3C!--MathML%3A%20%3Cmath%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F1998%2FMath%2FMathML%22%3E%3Cmi%3E%26%23x3B1%3B%3C%2Fmi%3E%3C%2Fmath%3E--%3E%3Cdefs%3E%3Cstyle%20type%3D%22text%2Fcss%22%2F%3E%3C%2Fdefs%3E%3Ctext%20font-family%3D%22Times%20New%20Roman%22%20font-size%3D%2218%22%20font-style%3D%22italic%22%20text-anchor%3D%22middle%22%20x%3D%224.5%22%20y%3D%2216%22%3E%26%23x3B1%3B%3C%2Ftext%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E)) and **beta** (![beta](data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%22%20xmlns%3Awrs%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wiris.com%2Fxml%2Fmathml-extension%22%20height%3D%2222%22%20width%3D%2211%22%20wrs%3Abaseline%3D%2216%22%3E%3C!--MathML%3A%20%3Cmath%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F1998%2FMath%2FMathML%22%3E%3Cmi%3E%26%23x3B2%3B%3C%2Fmi%3E%3C%2Fmath%3E--%3E%3Cdefs%3E%3Cstyle%20type%3D%22text%2Fcss%22%2F%3E%3C%2Fdefs%3E%3Ctext%20font-family%3D%22Times%20New%20Roman%22%20font-size%3D%2218%22%20font-style%3D%22italic%22%20text-anchor%3D%22middle%22%20x%3D%224.5%22%20y%3D%2216%22%3E%26%23x3B2%3B%3C%2Ftext%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E))

  + The forms of glucose are almost identical; they differ only in the **location of the H and OH groups attached to carbon 1**

    - Alpha glucose has the H above carbon 1 and the OH group below

      * Remember = **a**lpha has the H **a**bove
    - Beta glucose has the H below carbon 1 and the OH group above

      * Remember = **b**eta has the H **b**elow

***Alpha glucose (top) has the hydrogen above carbon 1 and the OH group below, while beta glucose (bottom) has the hydrogen below carbon 1 and the OH group above***

## Monosaccharides: Function

* The main function of monosaccharides is **to store energy**within their bonds

  + When the bonds are broken during respiration, energy is released
* The structure of glucose is related to its function as the main energy store for animals and plants

  + It is **soluble** so can be transported easily
  + It has many **covalent bonds which store energy**
* Monosaccharides can combine through condensation reactions to form larger carbohydrates
* Some monosaccharides are used to **form long, structural fibers,** which can be used as cellular support in some cell types
