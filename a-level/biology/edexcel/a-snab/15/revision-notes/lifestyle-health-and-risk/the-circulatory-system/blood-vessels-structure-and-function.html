thick and lines the lumen of all blood vessels.</p></li><li><p>It is very smooth and <b>reduces friction</b> for free blood flow</p></li><li><p>In arteries the endothelium is <b>highly folded</b>,

arteries</p></li><li><p>The layer of muscle cells strengthen the arteries so they can <b>withstand high pressure</b></p></li><li><p>It also enables them to constrict and narrow the lumen for reduced blood flow</p><ul><li><p><b>Contraction</b> of the muscle causes constriction of the lumen</p></li><li><p>This is useful for diverting blood flow away from certain locations e.g. away from the digestive system during exercise</p></li></ul></li><li><p>The elastic tissue helps to <b>maintain blood pressure</b> in the arteries</p><ul><li><p>It stretches and <b>recoils</b> to even out any fluctuations in pressure</p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p>The outer wall, sometimes referred to as the tunica adventitia, or tunica externa<b> </b></p><ul><li><p>Contains the structural protein <b>collagen</b></p></li><li><p>Collagen is a strong protein that <b>protects blood vessels</b> from damage by over-stretching</p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p>Arteries have a <b>narrow lumen</b> which helps to maintain a high blood pressure</p></li><li><p>A pulse is present in arteries as they stretch to accommodate an increased volume of blood with each heartbeat</p></li></ul><h4 id="veins">Veins</h4><ul><li><p>Veins return blood to the heart</p></li><li><p>They receive blood that has passed through capillary networks, so the blood pressure is very low</p></li><li><p>Veins

layer as veins don't have to withstand high pressure</p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p>The <b>lumen</b> of the vein is much wider than that of an artery</p><ul><li><p>A larger lumen helps to ensure that blood returns to the heart at an adequate speed</p></li><li><p>A large lumen reduces friction between the blood and the endothelium of the vein</p><ul><li><p>The rate of blood flow is slower in veins but a larger lumen means the volume of blood delivered per unit of time is equal to that of arteries</p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p>Veins contain <b>valves</b></p><ul><li><p>These prevent the backflow of blood, helping return blood to the heart</p></li></ul></li><li><p>A <b>pulse is absent</b> in veins due to the increased distance from the heart</p></li></ul><div class="mb-5"
