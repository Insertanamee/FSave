## Atherosclerosis

* There are a number of diseases of the heart, or cardiovascular diseases, that can affect blood vessels in different ways
* **Atherosclerosis,** also known as hardening of the arteries, is caused primarily by damage to the delicate endothelium of an artery followed by an **inflammatory response**

  + It is a progressive disease, meaning that it can worsen over time
* In a healthy artery the **endothelium** is smooth and unbroken to reduce friction between blood and the inside if the artery
* The steps involved in atherosclerosis are

  + **Damage**, e.g. by high blood pressure,is caused to the **endothelium**

    - Damage can also occur as a result of high levels of certain types of cholesterol, smoking, diabetes, obesity, and old age
  + An **inflammatory response** occurs and white blood cells such as macrophages accumulate in the damaged area
  + **Lipids** and **cholesterol** clump together with the macrophages **under the endothelium** and form **fatty streaks**

    - This is one of the first signs of atherosclerosis
  + **Platelets** can also add to the fatty deposit

    - Platelets are fragments of red blood cells involved in the blood clotting process
  + The collection of cholesterol, lipids, macrophages and platelets accumulate under the endothelium

    - The structure forms a **plaque** known as an **atheroma**
  + The atheroma narrows the lumen of the artery, reducing and restricting blood flow and thereby **raising blood pressure**
  + Over time, the plaque can **calcify and harden**, reducing elasticity of the artery wall and further increasing blood pressure
