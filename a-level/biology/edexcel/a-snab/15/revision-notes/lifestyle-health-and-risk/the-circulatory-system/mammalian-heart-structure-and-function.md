## Mammalian Heart: Structure & Function

* Circulatory systems are systems which **transport fluids** containing materials needed by the organism, as well as waste materials that need to be removed
* **Circulatory systems** are described as being either **open or closed**

  + In a closed circulatory system blood is pumped around the body and is always contained within a network of blood vessels
  + In an open circulatory system the blood, or blood equivalent, is inside the body cavity and bathes the organs
* Circulatory systems can also be either **double or single**

  + Double circulatory systems have two loops; one to the lungs and one to the body
  + Single circulatory systems have one loop that includes the lungs and the body
* **Humans have a closed, double circulatory system;** in one complete circuit of the body blood passes through the heart twice

  + The **right side** of the heart pumps blood **deoxygenated** blood to the lungs for gas exchange; this is the **pulmonary circulatory system**
  + Blood then returns to the **left side** of the heart, so that **oxygenated** blood can be pumped at high pressure around the body; this is the **systemic circulatory system**

#### Heart structure

* The human heart has a mass of around 300 g and is roughly the size of a closed fist
* The heart is a hollow, muscular organ located in the chest cavity
* It is protected in the chest cavity by the **pericardium**, a tough and fibrous sac
* The heart is divided into four chambers

  + The two top chambers are **atria**
  + The bottom two chambers are **ventricles**
* The left and right sides of the heart are separated by a wall of muscular tissue called the **septum**

  + The septum is very important for ensuring blood doesn’t mix between the left and right sides of the heart

***The human heart is adapted for pumping blood around the body***

***The heart is a muscular organ; the muscle itself is supplied with blood by the coronary arteries, enabling it to pump blood via a series of major blood vessels***

#### Valves in the heart

* Valves are important for keeping blood flowing forward in the **right direction** and for maintaining the correct pressure in the chambers of the heart

  + The right atrium and right ventricle are separated by an **atrioventricular (AV) valve** known as the **tricuspid valve**

    - Remember; the **ri**ght side of the heart has a t**ri**cuspid valve
  + The left atrium and left ventricle are separated by another AV known as the **bicuspid valve**
  + The right ventricle and the pulmonary artery are separated by a **semilunar (SL) valve** known as the **pulmonary valve**
  + The left ventricle and aorta are separated by another SL valve known as the **aortic valve**
* Valves in the heart

  + Open when the pressure of blood behind them is greater than the pressure in front of them
  + Close when the pressure of blood in front of them is greater than the pressure behind them
* The valves are attached to the heart walls by **valve tendons,** or **cords**; these prevent the valves from flipping inside out under high pressure

#### Blood vessels and the heart

* There are two blood vessels bringing blood into the heart; the **vena cava** and **pulmonary vein**

  + The vena cava brings blood from the body
  + The pulmonary vein brings blood from the lungs
* There are two blood vessels taking blood away from the heart; the **pulmonary artery** and **aorta**

  + The pulmonary artery takes blood to the lungs
  + The aorta takes blood to the body
* The muscle of the heart itself is supplied with blood by a series of blood vessels known as the **coronary arteries**

  + The coronary arteries can be seen running across the surface of the heart

#### Examiner Tips and Tricks

When looking at a diagram of a heart remember that the right side of the heart will appear on the left of the diagram, as if you are looking at someone else's heart in front of you
