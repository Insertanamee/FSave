## Core Practical 2: Preparing a Standard Solution

#### Volumetric Analysis

* **Volumetric analysis** is a process that uses the volume and concentration of one chemical reactant (**a volumetric solution**) to determine the concentration of another unknown solution
* The technique most commonly used is a **titration**
* The volumes are measured using two precise pieces of equipment, a **volumetric**or**graduated pipette**and a **burette**
* Before the titration can be done, the standard solution must be prepared
* Specific apparatus must be used both when preparing the standard solution and when completing the titration, to ensure that volumes are measured precisely

#### Making a Volumetric Solution

* Chemists routinely prepare solutions needed for analysis, whose concentrations are known precisely
* These solutions are termed **volumetric solutions** or **standard solutions**
* They are made as accurately and precisely as possible using three decimal place balances and volumetric flasks to reduce the impact of measurement uncertainties
* The steps are:

#### Volumes & concentrations of solutions

* The **concentration**of a solution is the amount of **solute**dissolved in a **solvent** to make 1 dm3of  **solution**

  + The solute is the substance that dissolves in a solvent to form a solution
  + The solvent is often water
* A **concentrated**solution is a solution that has a **high**concentration of solute
* A **dilute**solution is a solution with a **low**concentration of solute
* Concentration is usually expressed in one of three ways:

  + moles per unit volume
  + mass per unit volume
  + parts per million

#### Worked Example

Calculate the mass of sodium hydroxide, NaOH, required to prepare 250 cm3of a 0.200 mol dm-3 solution

**Answer:**

**Step 1**: Find the number of moles of NaOH needed from the concentration and volume:

* *number of moles  = concentration (mol dm**-3**) x volume (dm**3**)*

  + n = 0.200 *mol dm**-3* x 0.250 *dm**3*
  + n = **0.0500 mol**

**Step 2**: Find the molar mass of NaOH

* *M* = 22.99 + 16.00 + 1.01 = 40.00 g mol-1

**Step 3**: Calculate the mass required

* mass = moles x molar mass

  + mass =  0.0500 mol x 40.00 g mol-1   = **2.00 g**
