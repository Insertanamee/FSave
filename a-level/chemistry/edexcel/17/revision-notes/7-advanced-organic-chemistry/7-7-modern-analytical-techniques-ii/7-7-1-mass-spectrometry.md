## Using Mass Spectra

* At AS level, you have used mass spectrometry to determine:

  + Relative atomic mass from isotopic abundance
  + Possible molecular formulae from molecular ion peaks
  + Organic structures from fragmentation patterns
* **High resolution mass spectrometry** can be used to deduce / confirm molecular formulae
* High resolution mass spectrometers provide data accurate to four, or sometimes more, decimal places
* This means that a compounds molecular formula can sometimes be deduced by using atomic masses accurate to four decimal places

**Table of selected accurate relative atomic masses**

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Element | Hydrogen | Carbon | Nitrogen | Oxygen |
| Symbol | H | C | N | O |
| Accurate *A*r | 1.0078 | 12.0000 | 14.0031 | 15.9949 |

#### Worked Example

A compound is found to have an *M*r value of 58.0417.

Determine if the compound is:

1. C4H10
2. C2H6N2
3. C3H6O

**Answer**

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Element | Hydrogen | Carbon | Nitrogen | Oxygen |
| Symbol | H | C | N | O |
| Accurate *A*r | 1.0078 | 12.0000 | 14.0031 | 15.9949 |

1. C4H10 = (4 x 12.0000) + (10 x 1.0078) = 58.0780
2. C2H6N2 = (2 x 12.0000) + (6 x 1.0078) + (2 x 14.0031) = 58.0530
3. C3H6O =(3 x 12.0000) + (6 x 1.0078) + (15.9949) = 58.0417

* Therefore, the correct formula of the compound is C3H6O

#### Examiner Tips and Tricks

* High resolution mass spectrometry can inform you about the molecular formula, it cannot tell you about the actual structure

  + In the worked example above, the final answer was C3H6O but you cannot say whether this is propanal or propanone
  + You would have to use the fragments on the mass spectrum for further detail that might help deduce more information about the structure
* Sometimes you may calculate the molecular mass of a compound and it won't match the value given in the question exactly

  + In this case, you should:

    - Firstly, double check your calculation(s)
    - Secondly, choose the compound that is the closest
