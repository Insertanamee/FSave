## Rates of Reaction - Introduction

* The **rate of reaction**refers to the change in the amount or concentration of a reactant **or** product per unit time

  + The units for rate of reaction are mol dm-3 s-1
* It can be found by measuring:

  + The mass lost over time
  + The volume of produced over time
  + Colour changes, including by the use of colorimetry
  + pH changes over time
  + Changes in electrical conductivity
* The rate of reaction can be calculated by:

Rate of reaction = ![fraction numerator change space in space amout space of space reactants space or space products space left parenthesis mol space dm to the power of negative 3 end exponent right parenthesis over denominator time space left parenthesis straight s right parenthesis end

#### Rate of Reaction

The following general reaction will be used as an example to study the rate of reaction

**D (aq) → E (aq) + F (g)**

* The rate of reaction at different concentrations of Dis measured and tabulated

**Rate of reactions table**

![Table to show rates [D], downloadable AS & A Level Chemistry revision notes](5.2.1-Table-to-show-rates-D.png)

* A **directly proportional** relationship between the **rate** of reaction and **concentration of D** is observed when the results are plotted on a graph:

![Rates [D] graph, downloadable AS & A Level Chemistry revision notes](5.2.1-Rates-D-graph.png)

***Rate of reaction over various concentrations of D***

* This leads to a very common rate expression:

**Rate ∝ [D]       or       Rate =*****k*****[D]**

* This rate expression means that if the concentration of D is doubled, then the rate doubles
* Equally, if the concentration of D halves, then the rate halves

#### Rate Equations

* The following reaction will be used to discuss rate equations:

**A (aq) + B (aq) → C (aq) + D (g)**

* The rate equation for this reaction is:

**Rate of reaction =** ***k*** **[A]*****m*** **[B]*****n***

* Rate equations can only be determined experimentally and cannot be found from the stoichiometric equations
* In the above rate equation:

  + [A] and [B] are the concentrations of the reactants
  + *m* and *n* are orders with respect to each reactant involved in the reaction
* Products and catalysts may feature in rate equations
* Intermediates do not feature in rate equations
