Initial Rates Methods
---------------------

* The <b>initial rates method</b> determines the rate at the very start of the reaction when *t* = 0
* The initial rate can be found by:

  + Drawing a <b>concentration-time graph</b>
  + Adding a <b>tangent </b>at *t* = 0
  + Calculating the <b>gradient </b>of the tangent
* One example of measuring the initial rate could be the reaction of calcium carbonate with hydrochloric acid

  + The volume of carbon dioxide produced with different concentrations can be measured against time
  + The results are then plotted onto a graph
  + The tangent at *t* = 0 is then added
  + The gradient of the tangent can then be calculated to give the initial rate of the reaction

#### Worked Example

The concentration-time graph for the reaction of calcium carbonate with three different concentrations of hydrochloric acid is shown

  + Therefore, the initial rate of reaction is 1.05 mol dm<sup>-3</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>

#### Clock reactions

* <b>Clock reactions </b>are a more convenient way of measuring the initial rate of reaction using a <b>single measurement</b>
* The time taken, *t*, for a specific visual change in the reaction to occur is measured

  + These changes could be a colour change or formation of a precipitate
* The major assumption that clock reactions depend on is:

  + That there is no significant change in the rate of reaction between the start of the reaction and the time when the measurement is taken
* The initial rate is then proportional to ![1 over t](data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%22%20xmlns%3Awrs%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wiris.com%2Fxml%2Fmathml-extension%22%20height%3D%2247%22%20width%3D%2218%22%20wrs%3Abaseline%3D%2230%22%3E%3C!--MathML%3A%20%3Cmath%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F1998%2FMath%2FMathML%22%3E%3Cmfrac%3E%3Cmn%3E1%3C%2Fmn%3E%3Cmi%3Et%3C%2Fmi%3E%3C%2Fmfrac%3E%3C%2Fmath%3E--%3E%3Cdefs%3E%3Cstyle%20type%3D%22text%2Fcss%22%2F%3E%3C%2Fdefs%3E%3Cline%20stroke%3D%22%23000%22%20stroke-linecap%3D%22square%22%20stroke-width%3D%221%22%20x1%3D%222.5%22%20x2%3D%2214.5%22%20y1%3D%2223.5%22%20y2%3D%2223.5%22%2F%3E%3Ctext%20font-family%3D%22Times%20New%20Roman%22%20font-size%3D%2218%22%20text-anchor%3D%22middle%22%20x%3D%228.5%22%20y%3D%2216%22%3E1%3C%2Ftext%3E%3Ctext%20font-family%3D%22Times%20New%20Roman%22%20font-size%3D%2218%22%20font-style%3D%22italic%22%20text-anchor%3D%22middle%22%20x%3D%228.5%22%20y%3D%2241%22%3Et%3C%2Ftext%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E)

* The iodine clock experiment is a common clock reaction

  + This is covered in more detail in the PAG notes
* Here is a set of typical results for the iodine clock reaction:

<b>Specimen results for the iodine clock reaction table</b>

![](8.1.5-Iodine-clock-reaction-results-table.png)

* The initial rate is a relatively simple calculation

  + E.g. For a concentration of 0.01515 mol dm<sup>-3</sup>, the rate is ![1 over 40](data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%22%20xmlns%3Awrs%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wiris.com%2Fxml%2Fmathml-extension%22%20height%3D%2247%22%20width%3D%2227%22%20wrs%3Abaseline%3D%2230%22%3E%3C!--MathML%3A%20%3Cmath%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F1998%2FMath%2FMathML%22%3E%3Cmfrac%3E%3Cmn%3E1%3C%2Fmn%3E%3Cmn%3E40%3C%2Fmn%3E%3C%2Fmfrac%3E%3C%2Fmath%3E--%3E%3Cdefs%3E%3Cstyle%20type%3D%22text%2Fcss%22%2F%3E%3C%2Fdefs%3E%3Cline%20stroke%3D%22%23000%22%20stroke-linecap%3D%22square%22%20stroke-width%3D%221%22%20x1%3D%222.5%22%20x2%3D%2223.5%22%20y1%3D%2223.5%22%20y2%3D%2223.5%22%2F%3E%3Ctext%20font-family%3D%22Times%20New%20Roman%22%20font-size%3D%2218%22%20text-anchor%3D%22middle%22%20x%3D%2213.5%22%20y%3D%2216%22%3E1%3C%2Ftext%3E%3Ctext%20font-family%3D%22Times%20New%20Roman%22%20font-size%3D%2218%22%20text-anchor%3D%22middle%22%20x%3D%2213.5%22%20y%3D%2241%22%3E40%3C%2Ftext%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E) = 0.025 s<sup>-1</sup>
* A closer look at the results shows that as the concentration doubles, the rate also doubles

  + This can be linked back to the reaction being first order

* There are limitations to the accuracy of the clock reaction

  + These are, again, based on the assumption that the rate of reaction is constant
* As the reaction progresses, the concentration of the reactants decreases - typically on a curve

  + Therefore, when the time measured for the reaction to occur is short then there is a higher chance that the initial rate calculated will be closer to the true value
  + As the time taken for the reaction to occur, the value of the initial rate will become less accurate
* The initial rate measured during a clock reaction is an estimate

#### Examiner Tips and Tricks

* You can be expected to work with experimental data to deduce the order of reaction with respect to specific reactants
* This is done in the same that has been previously discussed in 5.5.2 Rate Equations
