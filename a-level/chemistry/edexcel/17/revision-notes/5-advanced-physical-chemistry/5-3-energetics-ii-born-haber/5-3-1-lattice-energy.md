## Lattice Energy

#### Lattice energy

* As with bond enthalpy, **lattice energy**(Δ*H**latt*ꝋ) can be expressed as a formation or dissociation process
* As a formation process, it is the enthalpy change when **1 mole** of an **ionic compound** is formed from its **gaseous ions** (under standard conditions)
* The Δ*H**latt*ꝋ is therefore **exothermic,** as when ions are **combined** to form an **ionic solid lattice** there is an extremely large release of energy

  + Since this is an exothermic process, the enthalpy change will have a **negative** value
  + Because of the huge release in energy when the gaseous ions combine, the value will be a very **large negative** value
* The large negative value of Δ*H**latt*ꝋ suggests that the **ionic compound** is much more **stable** than its **gaseous ions**

  + This is due to the **strong electrostatic forces of attraction** between the oppositely charged ions in the solid lattice
  + Since there are no electrostatic forces of attraction between the ions in the gas phase, the gaseous ions are **less stable** than the ions in the **ionic lattice**
  + The **more exothermic** the value is, the **stronger the ionic bonds** within the lattice are
* The Δ*H**latt*ꝋ of an ionic compound **cannot** be determined **directly** by one single experiment
* Multiple experimental values and an **energy cycle** are used to find the Δ*H**latt*ꝋ of ionic compounds
* The lattice energy (Δ*H**latt*ꝋ) of an ionic compound can be written as an equation

  + For example, sodium chloride is an ionic compound formed from sodium (Na+) and chloride (C*l*-) ions
  + Since the lattice energy is the enthalpy change when 1 mole of sodium chloride is formed from gaseous sodium and chloride ions, the equation for this process is:

**Na****+****(g) + Cl****-****(g) → NaCl (s)  Δ*****H******latt*****ꝋ** **= -776 kJ mol** **-1**

#### Worked Example

(i) Magnesium oxide

(ii) Lithium chloride

**Answer**

**Answer 1:**

**Mg****2+** **(g) + O****2-** **(g) → MgO (s)**

**Answer 2:**

**Li****+** **(g) + Cl****-** **(g) → LiCl (s)**

#### Enthalpy change of atomisation

* The **standard** **enthalpy change of atomisation** (Δ*H**at*ꝋ) is the **enthalpy change** when **1 mole of gaseous atoms** is formed from its **element** under standard conditions
* The Δ*H**at*ꝋ is always **endothermic** as energy is always required to **break** any bonds between the atoms in the element, to break the element into its gaseous atoms

  + Since this is always an endothermic process, the enthalpy change will always have a **positive** value
* Equations can be written to show the standard enthalpy change of atomisation (Δ*H**at*ꝋ) for elements
* For example, sodium in its elemental form is a **solid**
* The standard enthalpy change of atomisation for sodium is the energy required to form 1 mole of **gaseous** sodium atoms:

**Na (s) → Na (g)           Δ*****H******at*****ꝋ** **= +108 kJ mol** **-1**

#### Worked Example

**Writing equations for the standard enthalpy change of atomisation**

Write down the equations for the standard enthalpy change of atomisation (Δ*H**at*ꝋ) for:

(i) Potassium

(ii) Mercury

**Answer**

**Answer 1:**

Potassium in its elemental form is a **solid**, therefore the standard enthalpy change of atomisation is the energy required to form 1 mole of K (g) from K (s)

**K (s) → K (g)**

**Answer 2:**

Mercury in its elemental form is a **liquid**, so the standard enthalpy change of atomisation of mercury is the energy required to form 1 mole of Hg (g) from Hg (l)

**Hg (l) → Hg (g)**

#### Electron Affinity

* The **electron affinity** (Δ*H**ea*) of an element is the energy change when **one mole**of electrons is gained by **one mole** of gaseous atoms of an element to form **one mole**of gaseous ions under standard conditions
* For example, the first electron affinity of chlorine is:

**Cl (g)+ e****–****→ Cl****-** **(g)          Δ*****H******ea*****ꝋ** **= -364 kJ mol****-1**

* The **first electron affinity** is always **exothermic** as energy is released when electrons are attracted to the atoms
* However, the **second electron affinity** of an element can be **endothermic** as illustrated by oxygen:

**O****–** **(g) + e****–****→ O****2-** **(g)          Δ*****H******ea*****ꝋ** **= +844 kJ mol****-1**

* This is because a large force of **repulsion** must be overcome between the negatively charged ion and the second electron requiring a large input of energy
