## Brønsted–Lowry Acid & Base Theory

* **The Brønsted-Lowry Theory** defines acids and bases in terms of proton transfer between chemical compounds
* A **Brønsted acid**is a species that can donate a proton

  + For example, hydrogen chloride (HCl) is a Brønsted acid as it can lose a proton to form a hydrogen (H+) and chloride (Cl-) ion

**HCl (aq) → H****+****(aq) + Cl****-****(aq)**

* A **Brønsted base**is a species that can accept a proton

  + For example, a hydroxide (OH-) ion is a Brønsted base as it can accept a proton to form water

  **OH****-****(aq) + H****+****(aq) → H****2****O (l)**

## Conjugate Acid-Base Pairs

* **Conjugate acid-base pairs**are a pair of reactants and products that are linked to each other by the transfer of a proton
* In a reaction equilibrium the products are formed at the same rate as the reactants are used

CH3COOH (aq) + H2O (l)         ⇌    CH3COO-(aq)          +         H3O+ (aq)

 acid                 base                    conjugate base             conjugate acid

* The reactant CH3COOH is linked to the product CH3COO-by the transfer of a **proton**from the acid to the base
* Similarly, the H2O molecule is linked to H3O+ ion by the transfer of a proton
* These pairs are therefore called **conjugate acid-base pairs**

  + **Conjugate**here means related
  + In other words, the acid and base are related to each other by one proton difference
