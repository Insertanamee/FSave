Action of a Buffer Solution
---------------------------

* A <b>buffer solution </b>is a solution which resists changes in pH when small amounts of acids or alkalis are added

  + A buffer solution is used to keep the pH almost constant
  + A buffer can consists of <b>weak acid - conjugate base </b>or <b>weak base - conjugate acid</b>

#### Ethanoic acid & sodium ethanoate as a buffer

* A common buffer solution is an <b>aqueous mixture of ethanoic acid </b>and <b>sodium ethanoate</b>
* Ethanoic acid is a <b>weak acid </b>and partially ionises in solution to form a relatively low concentration of <b>ethanoate ions</b>

![Buffers equation 1](5.-Buffers-equation-1.png)

* Sodium ethanoate is a <b>salt</b> which fully ionises in solution

![Buffers equation 2](5.-Buffers-equation-2.png)

* There are <b>reserve supplies </b>of the acid (CH<sub>3</sub>COOH) and its conjugate base (CH<sub>3</sub>COO<sup>-</sup>)

  + The buffer solution contains relatively high concentrations of CH<sub>3</sub>COOH (due to partial ionisation of <b>ethanoic</b> <b>acid</b>) and CH<sub>3</sub>COO<sup>-</sup> (due to full ionisation of <b>sodium</b> <b>ethanoate</b>)

* In the <b>buffer solution</b>, the ethanoic acid is <b>in equilibrium </b>with hydrogen and ethanoate ions

![Buffers equation 3](5.-Buffers-equation-3.png)

* <b>When H</b><sup><b>+</b></sup><b> ions are added:</b>

  + The equilibrium position shifts to the <b>left</b> as H<sup>+ </sup>ions react with CH<sub>3</sub>COO<sup>-</sup> ions to form more CH<sub>3</sub>COOH until equilibrium is <b>re-established</b>
  + As there is a large reserve supply of CH<sub>3</sub>COO<sup>-</sup> the concentration of CH<sub>3</sub>COO<sup>-</sup> in solution doesn’t change much as it reacts with the added H<sup>+ </sup>ions
  + As there is a large reserve supply of CH<sub>3</sub>COOH the concentration of CH<sub>3</sub>COOH in solution doesn’t change much as CH<sub>3</sub>COOH is formed from the reaction of CH<sub>3</sub>COO<sup>-</sup> with H<sup>+</sup>
  + As a result, the pH remains reasonably constant

![Equilibria - Effect of adding H+, downloadable AS & A Level Chemistry revision notes](5.5-Equilibria-Effect-of-adding-H.png)

*<b>When hydrogen ions are added to the solution the pH of the solution would decrease; However, the ethanoate ions in the buffer solution react with the hydrogen ions to prevent this and keep the pH constant</b>*

* <b>When OH</b><sup><b>-</b></sup><b> ions are added:</b>

  + The OH<sup>-</sup> reacts with H<sup>+</sup> to form water

<b>OH</b><sup><b>-</b></sup><b> (aq) + H</b><sup><b>+  </b></sup><b>(aq) → H</b><sub><b>2</b></sub><b>O (l)</b>

* The H<sup>+</sup> concentration <b>decreases</b>

  + The equilibrium position shifts to the right and more CH<sub>3</sub>COOH molecules ionise to form more H<sup>+</sup>and CH<sub>3</sub>COO<sup>-</sup> until equilibrium is re-established

<b>CH</b><sub><b>3</b></sub><b>COOH (aq) → H</b><sup><b>+</b></sup><b> (aq) + CH</b><sub><b>3</b></sub><b>COO</b><sup><b>-</b></sup><b> (aq)</b>

* As there is a large reserve supply of CH<sub>3</sub>COOH the concentration of CH<sub>3</sub>COOH in solution doesn’t change much when CH<sub>3</sub>COOH dissociates to form more H<sup>+ </sup>ions

  + As there is a large reserve supply of CH<sub>3</sub>COO<sup>-</sup> the concentration of CH<sub>3</sub>COO<sup>-</sup> in solution doesn’t change much
  + As a result, the pH remains reasonably constant

*<b>When hydroxide ions are added to the solution, the hydrogen ions react with them to form water; The decrease in hydrogen ions would mean that the pH would increase however the equilibrium moves to the right to replace the removed hydrogen ions and keep the pH constant</b>*

#### Worked Example

Which of these mixtures would form a buffer solution with a pH <b>below </b>7?

☐ <b>A</b> NaOH (aq) and excess HCl (aq) ☐ <b>B</b> NaOH (aq) and excess CH<sub>3</sub>COOH (aq) ☐ <b>C</b> excess NaOH (aq) and HCl (aq) ☐ <b>D</b> excess NaOH (aq) and CH<sub>3</sub>COOH (aq)

<b>Answer: </b>

* <b>B</b> / NaOH (aq) and excess CH<sub>3</sub>COOH (aq)

This is because:

* A buffer with a pH lower than 7 can be made from a weak acid and its salt or by<b> partial neutralisation</b> of a weak acid
* <b>B</b> contains a weak acid that is in excess and NaOH, so the weak acid will be partially neutralised leaving a solution that contains a weak acid and its conjugate base - this is a buffer solution
* All of the other options are incorrect because the solutions would not form a buffer

Buffers & pH Calculations
-------------------------

* The pH of a <b>buffer</b> <b>solution</b> can be calculated using:

  + The *K*<sub>*a*</sub>of the <b>weak acid</b>
  + The <b>equilibrium concentration </b>of the <b>weak acid </b>and its <b>conjugate base</b> (salt)
* To determine the pH, the concentration of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>ions </b>is needed which can be found using the equilibrium expression

![Calculating pH of Buffer Solutions equation 1](6.-Calculating-pH-of-Buffer-Solutions-equation-1.png)

* To simplify the calculations, <b>logarithms </b>are used such that the expression becomes:

![Calculating pH of Buffer Solutions equation 2](6.-Calculating-pH-of-Buffer-Solutions-equation-2.png)

* Since -log<sub>10</sub> [H<sup>+</sup>] = pH, the expression can also be rewritten as:

![](5.6.5-Hendersen-equation-3.png)

* This is known as the Hendersen-Hasselbalch equation

#### Worked Example

Calculate the pH of a buffer solution containing 0.305 mol dm<sup>-3</sup> of ethanoic acid and 0.520 mol dm<sup>-3</sup> sodium ethanoate.

The *K*<sub>*a* </sub>of ethanoic acid  = 1.74 × 10<sup>-5</sup> mol dm<sup>-3 </sup>at 298 K

<b>Answer</b>

Ethanoic acid is a weak acid that ionises as follows:

<b>CH</b><sub><b>3</b></sub><b>COOH (aq) ⇌ H</b><sup><b>+</b></sup><b> (aq) + CH</b><sub><b>3</b></sub><b>COO</b><sup><b>-</b></sup><b> (aq)</b>

<b>Step 1: </b>Write down the equilibrium expression to find *K*<sub>*a*</sub>

![Calculating pH of Buffer Solutions equation 4](6.-Calculating-pH-of-Buffer-Solutions-equation-4.png)

<b>Step 2: </b>Rearrange the equation to find [H<sup>+</sup>]

![Calculating pH of Buffer Solutions equation 5](6.-Calculating-pH-of-Buffer-Solutions-equation-5.png)

<b>Step 3: </b>Substitute the values into the expression

![](5.6.5.png)

<b>   = 1.02 x 10-5 mol dm</b><sup><b>-3</b></sup>

<b>Step 4: </b>Calculate the pH

<b>   pH = - log [H+]</b>

<b>   = -log 1.02 x 10-5</b>

<b>   = 4.99</b>

#### How to make a buffer solution with a required pH

* To make a buffer solution with a pH of less than 7, you need to use a mixture of a weak acid and its conjugate base
* Conversely, you can make a buffer solution with a pH greater than 7 by using a mixture of a weak base and its conjugate acid
* Imagine we want to make a buffer solution with a pH of 5.00 at a temperature of 298K
* This would require a hydrogen ion concentration of

      [H<sup>+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub>] = 1.00 x 10<sup>-5</sup> mol dm<sup>-3</sup>

* The hydrogen ion concentration of a buffer solution of a weak acid and its conjugate base is calculated using the formula

Buffer Applications
-------------------

#### Controlling the pH of blood

* In humans, HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> ions act as a buffer to keep the blood pH between 7.35 and 7.45
* Body cells produce CO<sub>2</sub> during <b>aerobic respiration</b>
* This CO<sub>2</sub> will combine with water in blood to form a solution containing H<sup>+</sup> ions

<b>CO</b><sub><b>2</b></sub><b> (g) + H</b><sub><b>2</b></sub><b>O (l) ⇌ H</b><sup><b>+ </b></sup><b>(aq) + HCO</b><sub><b>3</b></sub><sup><b>- </b></sup><b>(aq)</b>

* This equilibrium between CO<sub>2</sub> and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>- </sup>is extremely important
* If the concentration of H<sup>+ </sup>ions is not regulated, the blood pH would drop and cause ‘<b>acidosis</b>’

  + <b>Acidosis </b>refers to a condition in which there is too much acid in the body fluids such as blood
  + This could cause body malfunctioning and eventually lead to coma
* <b>If there is an increase in H</b><sup><b>+ </b></sup><b>ions</b>
* The equilibrium position shifts to the <b>left </b>until equilibrium is restored

<b>CO</b><sub><b>2</b></sub><b> (g) + H</b><sub><b>2</b></sub><b>O (l) ⇌ H</b><sup><b>+ </b></sup><b>(aq) + HCO</b><sub><b>3</b></sub><sup><b>- </b></sup><b>(aq)</b>

* This reduces the concentration of H<sup>+</sup> and keeps the pH of the blood <b>constant</b>
* <b>If there is a decrease in H</b><sup><b>+ </b></sup><b>ions</b>

  + The equilibrium position shifts to the <b>right </b>until equilibrium is restored

<b>CO</b><sub><b>2</b></sub><b> (g) + H</b><sub><b>2</b></sub><b>O (l) ⇌ H</b><sup><b>+ </b></sup><b>(aq) + HCO</b><sub><b>3</b></sub><sup><b>- </b></sup><b>(aq)</b>

* This increases the concentration of H<sup>+</sup> and keeps the pH of the blood <b>constant</b>
