## Defining pH

* The acidity of an aqueous solution depends on the number of **H****+** ions in solution
* The **pH** is defined as:

**pH = -log[H****+****]**

* where [H+] is the concentration of hydrogen ions in mol dm–3
* Similarly, the **concentration** **of** **H****+**of a solution can be calculated if the pH is known by rearranging the above equation to:

**[H****+****] = 10****-pH**

* The pH scale is a logarithmic scale with base 10
* This means that each value is 10 times the value below it. For example, pH 5 is 10 times more acidic than pH 6.
* pH values are usually given to 2 decimal places
* The relationship between concentration is easily seen on the following table

## pH & Hydrogen Ion Concentration

#### Worked Example

**pH and H****+****calculations**

**Question 1:** Find the pH when the hydrogen concentration is 1.60 x 10-4 mol dm-3

**Question 2:** Find the hydrogen concentration when the pH is 3.10

**Answer**

**Answer 1:**

The pH of the solution is:

   pH  = -log[H+]

         = -log 1.6 x 10-4

         = 3.80

**Answer 2:**

The hydrogen concentration can be calculated by rearranging the equation for pH

   pH   = -log[H+]

   [H+] = 10-pH

          = 10-3.10

          = 7.94 x 10-4 mol dm-3

#### Worked Example

**Powers of 10**

10.0 cm3of an aqueous solution of an acid of pH = 1.0 is mixed with 990.0 cm3 of distilled water. What is the pH of the final solution?

**A.**1

**B.**2

**C.**3

**D.**10

**Answer**

The correct option is **C**.

* The total volume after dilution is 1000.0 cm3 so the concentration of H+ has been **reduced** by a factor of 100 or 10-2, which means an increase of 2 pH units

  + The final solution is therefore **pH 3**
