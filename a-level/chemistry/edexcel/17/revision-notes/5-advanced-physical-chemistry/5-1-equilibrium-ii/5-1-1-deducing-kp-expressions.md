## Kp Expressions

We have seen previously that equilibrium reactions can be quantified by reference to an equilibrium expression and equilibrium constant The **equilibrium expression**links the **equilibrium constant**, ***K******c***, to the **concentrations of reactants and products** at equilibrium taking the **stoichiometry** of the equation into account So, for a given reaction:

**aA + bB ⇌ cC + dD**

*K**c*is defined as follows:

***Equilibrium expression linking the equilibrium concentration of reactants and products at equilibrium***

* **Solids** are ignored in equilibrium expressions
* The *K**c* of a reaction is constant and only changes if the **temperature** of the reaction changes

#### Homogeneous reactions

* In the generic example above, if all the substances are gases, we can show the equation with that state symbol

**aA (g) + bB (g) ⇌ cC (g) + dD (g)**

* We can write a different equilibrium expression in terms of the **partial pressure** of the gases
* This equilibrium constant is called ***K******p*** and is defined as follows

***Equilibrium expression linking the partial pressures of reactants and products at equilibrium***

#### Heterogeneous reactions

* For heterogenous reactions**, solids** and **liquids** are ignored in *K**p* equilibrium expressions
* The *K**p* of a reaction is constant and only changes if the **temperature** of the reaction changes

#### Worked Example

Write a *K**p* expression for the following equilibria and deduce the units of *K**p* :

1. N2(g) + 3H2(g) ⇌ 2NH3(g)
2. CaCO3 (s)  ⇌ CaO(s) + CO2 (g)

**Answer 2**

**K****p** **=** ***p*****CO****2****(g) = kPa**
