Core Practical 9: Finding Ka for a Weak Acid
--------------------------------------------

* The *K*<sub>*a*</sub> of a weak acid may be determined by finding the pH at the half equivalence point
* At the half equivalence point *K*<sub>*a*</sub> = [H<sup>*+*</sup>]

<b>Key steps in the procedure</b>

* A pH probe or meter is calibrated before use
* 25 cm<sup>3</sup> of 0.1 mol dm<sup>*-*</sup><sup>3</sup> ethanoic acid is pipetted into a conical flask and a few drops of phenolphthalein indicator are added
* A burette is filled with 0.1 mol dm<sup>*-*</sup><sup>3</sup> sodium hydroxide solution
* The contents of the conical flask are titrated against the sodium hydroxide until the indicator just turns pink
* A further pipette containing 25 cm<sup>3 </sup>of the acid is then added to the flask and the pH is measured

<b>Specimen Results</b>

* pH at half equivalence point = 4.75

<b>Analysis</b>

* After the addition of the second portion of acid, the solution is effectively a half-neutralised sample of acid
* This is the half-equivalence point at which the *K*<sub>*a*</sub> = [H<sup>*+*</sup>]
* By measuring the pH at that point you can convert it to [H<sup>*+*</sup>] and hence find the *K*<sub>*a* </sub>of the acid

pH = 4.75

[H<sup>*+*</sup>] = 10<sup>-pH</sup> = 1.8 x 10<sup>-5</sup> mol dm<sup>-3</sup>

∴  *K*<sub>*a* </sub>= 1.8 x 10<sup>-5</sup> mol dm<sup>-3</sup>

* You can also say that the p*K*<sub>*a*</sub> = pH at the half-equivalence point

#### Examiner Tips and Tricks

The sources of uncertainty in this experiment include the measurements made by the pipette and burette, and the judgement of the end-point of the titration.Be careful, there is a single uncertainty in the pipette measurements as one reading was taken but there is double the uncertainty for the burette reading as there was the initial and final readings.
