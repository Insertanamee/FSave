## Halogen Displacement Reactions

* The reactivity of halogens is also shown by their **displacement** **reactions** with other halide ions in solutions
* A **more** **reactive** halogen can displace a **less reactive** halogen from a halide solution of the less reactive halogen
* Eg. The addition of chlorine water to a solution of bromine water:

**Cl****2****(aq) + 2NaBr (aq) → 2NaCl (aq) + Br****2****(aq)**

* The chlorine has displaced the bromine from solution as it is more reactive which can be summarised in the following ionic equation by removing the sodium spectator ions:

**Cl****2****(aq) + 2Br****-****(aq) → 2Cl****-****(aq) + Br****2****(aq)**

* Chlorine can also displace iodine from a solution of iodide ions:

**Cl****2****(aq) + 2I****-****(aq) → 2Cl****-****(aq) + I****2****(aq)**

We can see these are both redox reactions by taking a look at changes in the oxidation number of each element in the reaction Br and I both change from = -1 → 0 so the bromine and iodine have been oxidised in their respective reactions Cl = 0 → -1 so the chlorine has been reduced in both reactions No change in oxidation number for the sodium

#### Chlorine with Bromides & Iodides

If you add chlorine solution to colourless potassium bromide or potassium iodide solution a displacement reaction occurs:

* The solution becomes **yellow**-**orange** as bromine is formed
* The solution becomes **brown** as iodine is formed
* If an **organic solvent** is added, such as cyclohexane, the following observations are seen:

  + The organic layer will appear **yellow-orange** as bromine is formed
  + The organic layer will appear **purple** as iodine is formed
  + The organic solvent is useful as the the halogens are more soluble in this layer which helps observe the colour changes more easily
* Chlorine is **above** bromine and iodine in Group 7 so it is more reactive
* Chlorine will **displace** bromine or iodine from an aqueous solution of the metal halide:

**Cl****2****(aq) + 2KBr (aq) → 2KCl (aq) + Br****2****(aq)**

chlorine + potassium bromide **→**  potassium chloride + bromine

**Cl****2****(aq) + 2KI (aq) → 2KCl (aq) + I****2** **(aq)**

chlorine + potassium iodide **→**  potassium chloride + iodine

#### Bromine with Iodides

* Bromine is above iodine in Group 7 so it is **more** reactive
* Bromine will displace iodine from an aqueous solution of the metal iodide

bromine + potassium iodide **→**  potassium bromide + iodine

**Br****2****(aq) + 2KI (aq) → 2KBr (aq) + I****2** **(aq)**

* The reaction will turn **brown** as iodine is formed
* If an organic solvent is added the organic layer will appear **purple** as iodine is formed
* We can show that this is a redox reaction by looking at the changes in oxidation numbers:

  + I = -1 → 0 so the iodine has been oxidised
  + Br = 0 → -1 so the bromine has been reduced
  + No change in oxidation number for the potassium
* Rather than writing the full equation, we can also write the ionic equation by removing the potassium spectator ion

**Br****2** **(aq) + 2I****-** **(aq) → 2Br****-** **(aq) + I****2****(aq)**
