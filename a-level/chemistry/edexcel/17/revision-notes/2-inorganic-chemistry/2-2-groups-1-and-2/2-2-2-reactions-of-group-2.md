## Group 2 Elements

#### Reactions with water and oxygen

* The reaction of group 2 metals with oxygen follows the following general equation:

**2M (s) + O****2** **(g) → 2MO (s)**

Where M is any metal in group 2

Remember than Sr and Ba **also** form a peroxide, MO2

* The reaction of all metals with water follows the following general equation:

**M (s) + 2H****2****O (l) → M(OH)****2** **(s) + H****2** **(g)**

Except for, Be which does not react with water

**Group 2 Metals reacting with Water and with Oxygen - Equations**

|  | **Reaction with oxygen** | **Reaction with water** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Mg** | 2Mg (s) + O2 (g) → 2MgO (s) | Mg (s) + H2O (g) → MgO (s) + H2 (g) |
| **Ca** | 2 Ca (s) + O2 (g) → 2CaO (s) | Ca (s) + 2H2O (l) → Ca(OH)2 (s) + H2 (g) |
| **Sr** | 2Sr (s) + O2 (g) → 2SrO (s)  Sr (s) + O2 (g) → SrO2 (s) | Sr (s) + 2H2O (l) → Sr(OH)2 (aq) + H2 (g) |
| **Ba** | 2Ba (s) + O2 (g) → 2BaO (s)  Ba (s) + O2 (g) → BaO2 (s) | Ba (s) + 2H2O (l) → Ba(OH)2 (aq) + H2 (g) |

* Magnesium reacts **extremely slowly** with cold water:

**Mg (s) + 2H****2****O (l) → Mg(OH)****2** **(aq) + H****2** **(g)**

* The solution formed is **weakly** **alkaline** (pH 9-10) as **magnesium hydroxide** is only **slightly soluble**
* However, when magnesium is **heated** **in steam**, it reacts **vigorously** with steam to make magnesium oxide and hydrogen gas:

**Mg (s) + H****2****O (g) → MgO (s) + H****2** **(g)**

**Reactions with chlorine**

* Group 2 metals react with chlorine gas to give the metal chloride

  + For example

**Mg (s) + Cl****2** **(g) → MgCl****2****(s)**

## Group 2 Oxides

#### Reactions of Group 2 oxides with water

* All Group 2 oxides are **basic**, except for BeO which is **amphoteric** (it can act both as an acid and base)
* Group 2 oxides react water to form **alkaline** solutions which get more **alkaline** going down the group

**Group 2 Oxides reacting with Water**

| **Group 2 oxide** | **Reaction with water** | **Observations** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **MgO** | MgO (s) + H2O (l) → Mg(OH)2 (s) | MgO is only slightly soluble in water, therefore a weakly alkaline solution (pH 10.0) is formed |
| **CaO** | CaO (s) + H2O (l) → Ca(OH)2 (s) | A vigorous reaction which releases a lot of energy, causing some of the water to boil off as the solid lump seems to expand and open (pH 11.0) |
| **SrO** | SrO (s) + H2O (l) → Sr(OH)2 (aq) |  |
| **BaO** | BaO (s) + H2O (l) → Ba(OH)2 (aq) |  |

* Remember that:

**oxide + water → hydroxide**

* You should know that calcium hydroxide, when in solution, is also called **limewater**

#### Reactions of Group 2 oxides with acid

* Group 2 sulfates also form when a Group 2 oxide is reacted with sulfuric acid
* The **insoluble sulfates** form at the **surface** of the oxide, which means that the solid oxide beneath it can’t react with the acid
* This can be prevented to an extent by using the oxide in **powder** form and **stirring**, in which case neutralisation can take place
* Remember that:

**oxide + dilute hydrochloric acid → chloride + water**

**oxide + dilute sulfuric acid → sulfate + water**

#### Reactions of Group 2 hydroxides

* The Group 2 metal hydroxides form **colourless solutions of metal salts** when they react with a dilute acid
* The sulfates decrease in **solubility** going down the group (barium sulfate is an insoluble white precipitate)

**Group 2 Hydroxide Reactions with Dilute Acids**

| **Group 2 hydroxide** | **Reaction with dilute HCl** | **Reaction with dilute H****2****SO****4** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Mg(OH)****2** | Mg(OH)2 (s) + 2HCl (aq) → MgCl2 (aq) + 2H2O (l) | Mg(OH)2 (s) + H2SO4 (aq) → MgSO4 (aq) + 2H2O (l) |
| **Ca(OH)****2** | Ca(OH)2 (s) + 2HCl (aq) → CaCl2 (aq) + 2H2O (l) | Ca(OH)2 (s) + H2SO4 (aq) → CaSO4 (aq) + 2H2O (l) |
| **Sr(OH)****2** | Sr(OH)2 (s) + 2HCl (aq) → SrCl2 (aq) + 2H2O (l) | Sr(OH)2 (s) + H2SO4 (aq) → SrSO4 (s) + 2H2O (l) |
| **Ba(OH)****2** | Ba(OH)2 (s) + 2HCl (aq) → BaCl2 (aq) + 2H2O (l) | Ba(OH)2 (s) + H2SO4 (aq) → BaSO4 (s) + 2H2O (l) |

* Remember that:

**hydroxide + dilute hydrochloric acid → chloride + water**

**hydroxide + dilute sulfuric acid → sulfate + water**
