## Saturation Test

* Halogens can be used to test if a molecule is **unsaturated**(i.e. contains a double bond)
* Br2(aq) is an orange or yellow solution, called **bromine water**and this is the halogen most commonly used
* The unknown compound is **shaken**with the bromine water
* If the compound is unsaturated, an addition reaction will take place and the coloured solution will decolourise
