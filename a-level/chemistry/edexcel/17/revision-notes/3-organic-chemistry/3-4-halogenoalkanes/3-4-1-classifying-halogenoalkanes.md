## Classifying Halogenoalkanes

#### Naming halogenoalkanes

* We use the prefixes

  + **Fluoro** for fluorine
  + **Chloro** for chlroine
  + **Bromo** for bromine
  + **Iodo** for iodine
* The name of the halogenoalkane is based on the orignal alkane

  + So CH3CH2CH2Br would be 1-bromopropane
* The position of the halogen atom must be taken into account

  + So CH3CH(Br)CH3 would be 2-bromopropane
* Finally the substituents are listed alphabetically

  + So  CH3CH(Cl)CH2Br would be 1-bromo-2-chloropropane

#### Classifying halogenoalkanes

* Halogenoalkanes can be classified as **primary**, **secondary** or **tertiary** depending on the number of carbon atoms attached to the C-X functional group

  + A **primary halogenoalkane** is when a halogen is attached to a carbon that itself is attached to one other alkyl group
  + A **secondary halogenoalkane** is when a halogen is attached to a carbon that itself is attached to two other alkyl groups
  + A **tertiary halogenoalkane** is when a halogen is attached to a carbon that itself is attached to three other alkyl groups
