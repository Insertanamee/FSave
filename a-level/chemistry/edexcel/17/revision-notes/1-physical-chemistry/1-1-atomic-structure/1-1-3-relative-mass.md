Isotopic & Atomic Mass
----------------------

* The relative mass of an atom uses the carbon-12 isotope as the international standard
* One atom of carbon-12 has an accepted mass of 1.992646538 x 10<sup>-26</sup> kg
* It is not realistic to work with this value so the mass of a carbon-12 atom is fixed as exactly 12 atomic mass units / 12υ
* The standard mass for atomic mass is 1υ

  + Therefore, the standard mass for comparison is the mass of ![begin mathsize 16px style bevelled 1 over 12 end style](data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%22%20xmlns%3Awrs%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wiris.com%2Fxml%2Fmathml-extension%22%20height%3D%2224%22%20width%3D%2233%22%20wrs%3Abaseline%3D%2218%22%3E%3C!--MathML%3A%20%3Cmath%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F1998%2FMath%2FMathML%22%3E%3Cmstyle%20mathsize%3D%2216px%22%3E%3Cmfrac%20bevelled%3D%22true%22%3E%3Cmn%3E1%3C%2Fmn%3E%3Cmn%3E12%3C%2Fmn%3E%3C%2Fmfrac%3E%3C%2Fmstyle%3E%3C%2Fmath%3E--%3E%3Cdefs%3E%3Cstyle%20type%3D%22text%2Fcss%22%2F%3E%3C%2Fdefs%3E%3Cline%20stroke%3D%22%23000%22%20stroke-linecap%3D%22square%22%20stroke-width%3D%221%22%20x1%3D%227.5%22%20x2%3D%2216.5%22%20y1%3D%2220.5%22%20y2%3D%222.5%22%2F%3E%3Ctext%20font-family%3D%22Times%20New%20Roman%22%20font-size%3D%2216%22%20text-anchor%3D%22middle%22%20x%3D%224.5%22%20y%3D%2215%22%3E1%3C%2Ftext%3E%3Ctext%20font-family%3D%22Times%20New%20Roman%22%20font-size%3D%2216%22%20text-anchor%3D%22middle%22%20x%3D%2224.5%22%20y%3D%2220%22%3E12%3C%2Ftext%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E) of a carbon-12 atom

#### Relative isotopic mass

* Relative isotopic mass is defined as the mass of an isotope relative to ![begin mathsize 16px style bevelled 1 over 12 end style](data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%22%20xmlns%3Awrs%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wiris.com%2Fxml%2Fmathml-extension%22%20height%3D%2224%22%20width%3D%2233%22%20wrs%3Abaseline%3D%2218%22%3E%3C!--MathML%3A%20%3Cmath%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F1998%2FMath%2FMathML%22%3E%3Cmstyle%20mathsize%3D%2216px%22%3E%3Cmfrac%20bevelled%3D%22true%22%3E%3Cmn%3E1%3C%2Fmn%3E%3Cmn%3E12%3C%2Fmn%3E%3C%2Fmfrac%3E%3C%2Fmstyle%3E%3C%2Fmath%3E--%3E%3Cdefs%3E%3Cstyle%20type%3D%22text%2Fcss%22%2F%3E%3C%2Fdefs%3E%3Cline%20stroke%3D%22%23000%22%20stroke-linecap%3D%22square%22%20stroke-width%3D%221%22%20x1%3D%227.5%22%20x2%3D%2216.5%22%20y1%3D%2220.5%22%20y2%3D%222.5%22%2F%3E%3Ctext%20font-family%3D%22Times%20New%20Roman%22%20font-size%3D%2216%22%20text-anchor%3D%22middle%22%20x%3D%224.5%22%20y%3D%2215%22%3E1%3C%2Ftext%3E%3Ctext%20font-family%3D%22Times%20New%20Roman%22%20font-size%3D%2216%22%20text-anchor%3D%22middle%22%20x%3D%2224.5%22%20y%3D%2220%22%3E12%3C%2Ftext%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E) of a carbon-12 atom
* For A Level Chemistry it is common to work with mass values rounded to one decimal place, for example:
* The accurate relative isotopic mass of nitrogen is 14.00307401 but this is rounded to 14.0
* The accurate relative isotopic mass of oxygen is 15.99491464 but this is rounded to 16.0

#### Relative atomic mass

* Most elements on the Periodic Table represent a mixture of different isotopes, which is shown as their relative atomic mass (*A*<sub>r</sub>)
* The relative atomic mass is the weighted mean / average mass of an atom relative to ![begin mathsize 16px style bevelled 1 over 12 end style](data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%22%20xmlns%3Awrs%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wiris.com%2Fxml%2Fmathml-extension%22%20height%3D%2224%22%20width%3D%2233%22%20wrs%3Abaseline%3D%2218%22%3E%3C!--MathML%3A%20%3Cmath%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F1998%2FMath%2FMathML%22%3E%3Cmstyle%20mathsize%3D%2216px%22%3E%3Cmfrac%20bevelled%3D%22true%22%3E%3Cmn%3E1%3C%2Fmn%3E%3Cmn%3E12%3C%2Fmn%3E%3C%2Fmfrac%3E%3C%2Fmstyle%3E%3C%2Fmath%3E--%3E%3Cdefs%3E%3Cstyle%20type%3D%22text%2Fcss%22%2F%3E%3C%2Fdefs%3E%3Cline%20stroke%3D%22%23000%22%20stroke-linecap%3D%22square%22%20stroke-width%3D%221%22%20x1%3D%227.5%22%20x2%3D%2216.5%22%20y1%3D%2220.5%22%20y2%3D%222.5%22%2F%3E%3Ctext%20font-family%3D%22Times%20New%20Roman%22%20font-size%3D%2216%22%20text-anchor%3D%22middle%22%20x%3D%224.5%22%20y%3D%2215%22%3E1%3C%2Ftext%3E%3Ctext%20font-family%3D%22Times%20New%20Roman%22%20font-size%3D%2216%22%20text-anchor%3D%22middle%22%20x%3D%2224.5%22%20y%3D%2220%22%3E12%3C%2Ftext%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E) of the mass of a carbon-12 atom

Molecular & Formula Mass
------------------------

* We have seen previously that the symbol for the relative atomic mass is *A*<sub>*r*</sub>
* This is calculated from the <b>mass number</b> and <b>relative abundances</b> of all the <b>isotopes</b> of a particular element
* The symbol for the <b>relative formula mass</b> is *<b>M</b>*<sub>*<b>r</b>*</sub><b> </b>and it refers to the<b> total mass</b> of the substance

  + The term relative formula mass should be used for compounds with giant structures e.g. ionic compounds such as sodium chloride
  + If the substance is molecular you can use the term <b>relative molecular mass</b>
* To calculate the *M*<sub>*r*</sub> of a substance, you have to add up the <b>relative atomic masses</b> of all the atoms present in the formula

#### Examiner Tips and Tricks

It is expected that you will use relative atomic mass values from the Periodic Table

* This means that your values will be more accurate
* e.g. potassium carbonate = (2 x 39.1) + 12.0 + (3 x 16.0) = 138.2

If you are in any doubt whether to use relative molecular mass or relative formula mass, use the latter because it applies to all compounds whether they are ionic or covalent.
