## Electron Pair Repulsion & Shape

* The **valence shell electron pair repulsion theory**(VSEPR) predicts the shape and bond angles of molecules
* Electrons are **negatively charged**and will repel other electrons when close to each other
* In a molecule, the **bonding pairs of electrons**will repel other electrons around the **central atom**forcing the molecule to adopt a shape in which these **repulsive forces**are minimised
* When determining the **shape** and **bond** angles of a molecule, the following VSEPR rules should be considered:

  + Valence shell electrons are those electrons that are found in the outer shell
  + Electron pairs repel each other as they have the same charge
  + Lone pair electrons repel each other more than bonded pairs
  + Repulsion between multiple and single bonds is treated the same as for repulsion between single bonds
  + Repulsion between pairs of double bonds are greater
  + The most stable shape is adopted to minimize the repulsion forces
* Different types of electron pairs have different repulsive forces

  + Lone pairs of electrons have a more concentrated electron charge cloud than bonding pairs of electrons
  + The cloud charges are wider and closer to the central atom’s nucleus
  + The order of repulsion is therefore: lone pair – lone pair > lone pair – bond pair > bond pair – bond pair

## Shapes & Angles

* Molecules can adapt the following shapes and bond angles:

***Molecules of different shapes can adapt with their corresponding bond angles***

#### Worked Example

**VSEPR & shapes of molecules**

Draw the shape of the following molecules:

1. Phosphorus(V) chloride
2. N(CH3)3
3. CCl4

**Answers:**

**Answer 1:**

* Phosphorus is in group 15, so has 5 valence electrons; Cl is in group 17, so has 17 valence electrons

  + All 5 electrons are used to form covalent bonds with Cl and there are no lone pairs
  + This gives a **trigonal** (or **triangular**)**bipyramidal** shape:

***Phosphorus pentachloride or phosphorus (V) chloride***

**Answer 2:**

* Nitrogen is in group 15, so has 5 valence electrons; carbon is in group 14, so has 4 valence electrons, 3 of which are already used in the covalent bonds with hydrogen

  + Three of the valence electrons in N are used to form bonding pairs, so there is one lone pair left
  + N(CH3)3has a **triangular pyramid** shape:

***Trimethylamine***

**Answer 3:**

* Carbon is in group 14, so has 4 valence electrons; chlorine is in group 17, so has 7 valence electrons

  + All four valence electrons are used to bond with chlorine and there are no lone pairs
  + The shape of CCl4 is **tetrahedral**
