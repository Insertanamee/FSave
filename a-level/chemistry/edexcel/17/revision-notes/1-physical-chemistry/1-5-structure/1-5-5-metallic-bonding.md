## Metallic Bonding

* **Metal** atoms are tightly packed together in **lattice** structures
* When the metal atoms are in lattice structures, the electrons in their outer shells are free to move throughout the structure
* The free-moving**electrons** are called **‘delocalised electrons’** and they are not bound to their atom
* When the electrons are delocalised, the metal atoms become **positively** charged ions
* The positive charges **repel** each other and keep the neatly arranged lattice in place
* There are very strong **forces** between the positive metal centres and the ‘sea’ of delocalised electrons
