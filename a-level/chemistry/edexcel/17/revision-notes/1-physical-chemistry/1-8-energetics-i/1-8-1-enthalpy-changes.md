Enthalpy Change Definitions
---------------------------

* To be able to compare the changes in enthalpy between reactions, all thermodynamic measurements are carried out under standard conditions
* These standard conditions are:

  + A <b>pressure</b> of 100 kPa (you may see some older exam questions that use a figure of 101 kPa; the exact figure is 101 325 Pa, but it has been simplified in the current syllabus for problem-solving purposes)
  + A <b>temperature</b> of 298 K (25 <sup>o</sup>C)
  + Each substance involved in the reaction is in its <b>standard physical state</b> (solid, liquid or gas)
* To show that a reaction has been carried out under standard conditions, the symbol Ꝋ is used

  + Δ*H*<sup>Ꝋ</sup> = the standard enthalpy change
* There are a number of key definitions relating to enthalpy changes that you need to know

#### Examiner Tips and Tricks

You will see various enthalpy change symbols used with subtle changes, e.g.

Δ*H*<sub>c</sub><sup>Ꝋ</sup> or Δ<sub>c</sub>*H*<sup>Ꝋ</sup> for enthalpy of combustion

Whichever symbol you use must have the following basic points:

* Δ to represent change
* *H* to represent enthlalpy
* Ꝋ to respresent standard conditions
* A symbol to represent the type of enthalpy change occurring, e.g.

  + c for combustion
  + f for formation
  + neut for neutralisation
  + r for reaction

#### Worked Example

<b>Calculating the enthalpy change of reaction</b>

One mole water is formed from hydrogen and oxygen, releasing 286 kJ of energy

H<sub>2 </sub>(g) + ½O<sub>2 </sub>(g) <b>→ </b>H<sub>2</sub>O (I)      Δ*H*<sub>*r*</sub><sup>Ꝋ</sup> = -286 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>

Calculate Δ*H*<sub>*r*</sub><sup>Ꝋ </sup>for the reaction below:

2H<sub>2 </sub>(g) + O<sub>2 </sub>(g) <b>→ </b>2H<sub>2</sub>O (I)

<b>Answer</b>

* Since two moles of water molecules are formed in the question above, the energy released is simply:

* Δ*H*<sub>*r*</sub><sup>Ꝋ</sup> = 2 mol x (-286 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>) = -572 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>

#### Worked Example

<b>Calculating the enthalpy change</b>

Calculate ΔH<sub>f</sub><sup>ꝋ</sup> for the reaction below, given that ΔH<sub>f</sub><sup>ꝋ</sup> [Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>(s)] = -824.2 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>

4Fe(s) + 3 O<sub>2</sub>(g) → 2 Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>(s)

<b>Answer</b>

* Since two moles of Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (s) are formed the total change in enthalpy for the reaction above is:

  + Δ*H*<sub>*f*</sub><sup>Ꝋ</sup> =  2 x ( -824.2 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>) = - 1648 kJ

#### Worked Example

<b>Calculating enthalpy changes</b>

Identify each of the following as Δ*H*<sub>*r*</sub><sup>Ꝋ</sup>, Δ*H*<sub>*f*</sub><sup>Ꝋ</sup>, ΔH<sub>c</sub><sup>Ꝋ</sup> or ΔH<sub>neut</sub><sup>Ꝋ</sup>

1. MgCO<sub>3 </sub>(s) <b>→ </b>MgO (s) + CO<sub>2 </sub>(g)
2. C (graphite) + O<sub>2 </sub>(g) <b>→ </b>CO<sub>2 </sub>(g)
3. HCl (aq) + NaOH (aq) <b>→ </b>NaCl (aq) + H<sub>2</sub>O (I)

<b>Answer</b>

<b>Answer 1: </b>Δ*H*<sub>*r*</sub><sup>Ꝋ</sup>

<b>Answer 2: </b>Δ*H*<sub>*f*</sub><sup>Ꝋ</sup> as one mole of CO<sub>2</sub> is formed from its elements in standard state *and* Δ*H*<sub>*c*</sub><sup>Ꝋ</sup> as one mole of carbon is burnt in oxygen

<b>Answer 3: </b>Δ*H*<sub>*neut*</sub><sup>Ꝋ</sup> as one mole of water is formed from the reaction between an acid and an alkali

#### Examiner Tips and Tricks

The Δ*H*<sub>*f*</sub><sup>Ꝋ</sup> of an <b>element</b> in its standard state is zero.

For example, Δ*H*<sub>*f*</sub><sup>Ꝋ</sup> of O<sub>2</sub>(g) is 0 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>
