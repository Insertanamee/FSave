Empirical & Molecular Formula Calculations
------------------------------------------

#### Empirical formula

* <b>Empirical formula </b>is the <b>simplest whole number ratio</b> of the elements present in one molecule or formula unit of the compound
* It is calculated from knowledge of the ratio of masses of each element in the compound
* The empirical formula can be found by determining the <b>mass</b> of each element present in a sample of the compound
* It can also be deduced from data that gives the <b>percentage compositions by mass</b> of the elements in a compound

#### Worked Example

<b>Empirical formula from mass </b>Determine the empirical formula of a compound that contains 10 g of hydrogen and 80 g of oxygen.

<b>Answer:</b>

* The above example shows how to calculate empirical formula from the mass of each element present in the compound
* The example below shows how to calculate the empirical formula from percentage composition

#### Worked Example

#### Molecular formula

* The <b>molecular formula </b>gives the exact numbers of atoms of each element present in the formula of the compound
* The molecular formula can be found by dividing the <b>relative</b> <b>formula</b> <b>mass</b> of the <b>molecular formula </b>by the <b>relative formula mass</b> of the <b>empirical formula</b>
* <b>Multiply</b> the number of each element present in the empirical formula by this number to find the molecular formula

#### Worked Example

<b>Calculating molecular formula </b>The empirical formula of X is C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10</sub>S and the relative molecular mass of X is 180.2

What is the molecular formula of X?

(<i>A</i><sub>r</sub> data: C = 12.0, H = 1.0, S = 32.1 )

<b>Answer</b>

<b>Step 1:</b> Calculate relative mass of the empirical formula

* Relative empirical mass = (C x 4) + (H x 10) + (S x 1)

  + Relative empirical mass = (12.0 x 4) + (1.0 x 10) + (32.1 x 1)
  + Relative empirical mass = 90.1

<b>Step 2:</b> Divide relative formula mass of <b>X</b> by relative empirical mass

* Ratio between M<sub>r</sub> of X and the M<sub>r </sub>of the empirical formula = 180.2 / 90.1

  + Ratio between M<sub>r</sub> of X and the M<sub>r </sub>of the empirical formula = 2

<b>Step 3:</b> Multiply each number of elements by 2

* (C<sub>4</sub> x 2) + (H<sub>10</sub> x 2) + (S x 2)     =    (C<sub>8</sub>) + (H<sub>20</sub>) + (S<sub>2</sub>)

  + Molecular Formula of<b> X </b>is C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>20</sub>S<sub>2</sub>

#### Water of Crystallisation

* <b>Water of crystallisation</b> is when some compounds can form <b>crystals </b>which have <b>water </b>as part of their structure
* A compound that contains water of crystallisation is called a <b>hydrated compound</b>
* The water of crystallisation is separated from the main formula by a <b>dot</b> when writing the chemical formula of hydrated compounds

  + E.g. hydrated copper(II) sulfate is CuSO<sub>4</sub><b>∙</b>5H<sub>2</sub>O
* A compound which doesn’t contain water of crystallisation is called an <b>anhydrous compound</b>

  + E.g. anhydrous copper(II) sulfate is CuSO<sub>4</sub>
* A compound can be hydrated to <b>different degrees</b>

  + E.g. cobalt(II) chloride can be hydrated by <b>six</b> or <b>two</b> water molecules
  + CoCl<sub>2</sub> <b>∙</b>6H<sub>2</sub>O or CoCl<sub>2</sub> <b>∙</b>2H<sub>2</sub>O

* The conversion of anhydrous compounds to hydrated compounds is reversible by heating the hydrated salt:

Hydrated:        CuSO<sub>4</sub>•5H<sub>2</sub>O ⇌ CuSO<sub>4</sub> + 5H<sub>2</sub>O        :Anhydrous

* The degree of hydration can be calculated from experimental results:

  + The mass of the hydrated salt must be measured before heating
  + The salt is then heated until it reaches a constant mass
  + The two mass values can be used to calculate the number of moles of water in the hydrated salt - known as the water of crystallisation

#### Worked Example

<b>Calculating water of crystallisation </b>10.0 g of hydrated copper sulfate are heated to a constant mass of 5.59 g. Calculate the formula of the original hydrated copper sulfate. (<i>M</i><sub>r</sub> data: CuSO<sub>4</sub> = 159.6, H<sub>2</sub>O = 18.0)

<b>Answer:</b>

| --- | --- | --- |
| List the components | CuSO<sub>4</sub> | H<sub>2</sub>O |

#### Ideal Gas Equation

* The <b>ideal gas equation </b>is:

<i>PV</i> = <i>nRT</i>

* <i>P</i> = pressure in pascals (Pa)

  + <i>V</i> = volume in cubic metres (m<sup>3</sup>)
  + <i>n</i> = the amount of substance in moles (mol)
  + <i>R</i> = the gas constant, which is given in the Data Booklet as 8.31 J mol<sup>-1</sup> K<sup>-1</sup>
  + <i>T</i> = temperature in Kelvin (K)

#### Examiner Tips and Tricks

There are several calculations in Chemistry where you need to convert the units to or from SI units

The ideal gas equation has three:

1. Pressure is often quoted in kPa but the calculation needs pressure in Pa

   * kPa to Pa = multiply by 1000 or 10<sup>3</sup>
2. Volume is usually quoted in cm<sup>3</sup> or dm<sup>3</sup> but the calculation needs volume in m<sup>3</sup>

   * cm<sup>3</sup> to m<sup>3</sup> = divide by 1000000 or multiply by 10<sup>-6</sup>
   * dm<sup>3</sup> to m<sup>3</sup> = divide by 1000 or multiply by 10<sup>-3</sup>
3. Temperature can be quoted in Kelvin or Celsius

   * Celsius to Kelvin = + 273

This is why you should always show your working! Examiners can't take all of your marks for one error, if you show your working then they should check through for errors and award marks accordingly

* The ideal gas equation can be used to find the amount of moles in a gaseous substance

  + It can also be used for volatile liquids at temperatures above their boiling point
* If the mass of the substance is known, then the molar mass can be calculated

  + This can then be used with empirical formula data to determine the molecular formula of a compound

#### Worked Example

An unknown compound was analysed and found to contain 66.7% of carbon, 11.1% hydrogen and the remainder was oxygen

0.135 g of the unknown compound had a volume of 56.0 cm<sup>3</sup> at a temperature of 90 <sup>o</sup>C and a pressure of 101 kPa

Determine the molecular formula of the unknown compound

<b>Answer:</b>

<b>Step 1: </b>Calculate the number of moles of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen

|  |  |  |

<b>Step 2:</b> Divide by the smallest answer to get the ratio

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Carbon: <math>5.5581.3875 ={"language":"en","fontFamily":"Times New Roman","fontSize":"18"}</math>4 | Hydrogen: <math>11.11.3875 ={"language":"en","fontFamily":"Times New Roman","fontSize":"18"}</math>8 | Oxygen: <math>1.38751.3875 ={"language":"en","fontFamily":"Times New Roman","fontSize":"18"}</math>1 |

<b>Step 3: </b>State the empirical formula

* The empirical formula is C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O

<b>Step 4:</b> Calculate the amount in moles, using <i>PV</i> = <i>nRT</i>

* <i>n</i> = <math>=PVRT=(101×103) ×(56.0×10-6)8.31 × (90 + 273)={"language":"en","fontFamily":"Times New Roman","fontSize":"18"}</math>1.875 x 10<sup>-3</sup> moles

<b>Step 5:</b> Calculate the molar mass

* Molar mass <math>=0.1351.875 ×10-3={"language":"en","fontFamily":"Times New Roman","fontSize":"18"}</math>72

<b>Step 6:</b> Deduce the molecular formula

* The empirical formula, C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O, has a mass of (4 x 12.0) + (8 x 1.0) + 16.0 = 72.0

  + Therefore, the molecular formula is also C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O

Percentage Composition
----------------------

* The percentage by mass of an element in a compound can be calculated using the following equation:

<math>% mass of an element=Ar× number of atoms of the elementMr of the compound×100{"language":"en","fontFamily":"Times New Roman","fontSize":"18","autoformat":true}</math>
