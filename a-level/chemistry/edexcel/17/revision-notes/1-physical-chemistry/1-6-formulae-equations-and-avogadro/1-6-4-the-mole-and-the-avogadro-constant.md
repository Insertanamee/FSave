## The Mole & Avogadro

* The **Avogadro constant** (*N**A* or *L*) is the number of particles equivalent to the relative **atomic** **mass** or **molecular mass** of a substance

  + The Avogadro constant applies to atoms, molecules, ions and electrons
* The value of *N**A* is **6.02 x 10****23** **g mol****-1**
* The mass of a substance with this number of particles is called a **mole** (mol)

  + This can be called the **molar mass**
  + This is the mass of substance that contains the same number of fundamental units as exactly 12.00g of carbon-12
* The amount / number of moles of a substance, *n*, the mass of the substance, *m*, and the molar mass, *M*, are linked by the equation:

*n* = ![fraction numerator m a s s comma space m over denominator M o l a r space m a s s comma space M end

* One mole of any element is equal to the relative atomic mass of that element in grams

  + If you had one mole of carbon in your hand, that is 6.02 x 1023 atoms of carbon, you would have a mass of 12.00 g
  + One mole of water would have a mass of (2 x 1 + 16) = 18 g

#### Worked Example

1. What is the molar mass of water?
2. How many moles are there in 100 g of water?
3. How many water molecules are there in 100 g of water?

**Answers**

1. Molar mass of water, H2O = (2 x 1.0) + 16.0 = 18.0 g mol-1
2. Moles ![equals fraction numerator m a s s over denominator m o l a r space m a s s end fraction space equals space fraction numerator 100 over denominator 18.0 end fraction space

moles (to 3 s.f.)
3. Number of molecules = number of moles x Avogadro's constant = 5.56 x (6.02 x 1023) = 3.35 x 1024 molecules

#### Worked Example

What is the mass of the following:

1. Five hundred million atoms of platinum
2. (1.31 x 1022) molecules of ethanol

**Answer 1:**

Number of moles ![equals space fraction numerator number space of space particles over denominator Avogadro apostrophe straight s space constant comma space straight N subscript straight A end

x10-16 moles

Mass = moles x molar mass = (8.31 x10-16) x 195.1 = 1.62 x 10-13 g (lots of atoms, a tiny mass)

**Answer 2:**

Molar mass of ethanol, C2H5OH = (2 x 12.0) + (5 x 1.0) + 16.0 + 1.0 = 46.0 g mol-1

#### Examiner Tips and Tricks

* When you are completing calculations using Avogadro's constant, you may end up with answers that seem very large or very small - don't automatically assume that they must be wrong
* Remember, Avogadro's constant is a VERY large number:

  + 6.02 x 1023 or 602 000 000 000 000 000 000 000
* So when you multiply or divide by Avogadro's constant, your answers will, naturally, become very large or very small
