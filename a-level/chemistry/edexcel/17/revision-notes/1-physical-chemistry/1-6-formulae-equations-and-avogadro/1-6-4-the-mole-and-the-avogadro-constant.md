The Mole & Avogadro
-------------------

* The <b>Avogadro constant </b>(<i>N</i><sub><i>A</i></sub> or <i>L</i>) is the number of particles equivalent to the relative <b>atomic</b> <b>mass</b> or <b>molecular mass </b>of a substance

  + The Avogadro constant applies to atoms, molecules, ions and electrons
* The value of <i>N</i><sub><i>A</i></sub> is <b>6.02 x 10</b><sup><b>23</b></sup><b> g mol</b><sup><b>-1</b></sup>
* The mass of a substance with this number of particles is called a <b>mole</b> (mol)

  + This can be called the <b>molar mass</b>
  + This is the mass of substance that contains the same number of fundamental units as exactly 12.00g of carbon-12
* The amount / number of moles of a substance, <i>n</i>, the mass of the substance, <i>m</i>, and the molar mass, <i>M</i>, are linked by the equation:

<i>n</i> = <math>mass, mMolar mass, M{"language":"en","fontFamily":"Times New Roman","fontSize":"18"}</math>

* One mole of any element is equal to the relative atomic mass of that element in grams

  + If you had one mole of carbon in your hand, that is 6.02 x 10<sup>23</sup> atoms of carbon, you would have a mass of 12.00 g
  + One mole of water would have a mass of (2 x 1 + 16) = 18 g

#### Worked Example

1. What is the molar mass of water?
2. How many moles are there in 100 g of water?
3. How many water molecules are there in 100 g of water?

<b>Answers</b>

1. Molar mass of water, H<sub>2</sub>O = (2 x 1.0) + 16.0 = 18.0 g mol<sup>-1</sup>
2. Moles <math>=massmolar mass = 10018.0 ={"language":"en","fontFamily":"Times New Roman","fontSize":"18"}</math>5.56 moles (to 3 s.f.)
3. Number of molecules = number of moles x Avogadro's constant = 5.56 x (6.02 x 10<sup>23</sup>) = 3.35 x 10<sup>24</sup> molecules

#### Worked Example

What is the mass of the following:

1. Five hundred million atoms of platinum
2. (1.31 x 10<sup>22</sup>) molecules of ethanol

<b>Answer 1:</b>

Number of moles <math>= number of particlesAvogadro's constant, NA = 500 ×1066.02 ×1023 ={"language":"en","fontFamily":"Times New Roman","fontSize":"18"}</math>8.31 x10<sup>-16</sup> moles

Mass = moles x molar mass = (8.31 x10<sup>-16</sup>) x 195.1 = 1.62 x 10<sup>-13</sup> g (lots of atoms, a tiny mass)

<b>Answer 2:</b>

Molar mass of ethanol, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH = (2 x 12.0) + (5 x 1.0) + 16.0 + 1.0 = 46.0 g mol<sup>-1</sup>

Number of moles <math>= number of particlesAvogadro's constant, NA = 1.31 × 10226.02 ×1023 ={"language":"en","fontFamily":"Times New Roman","fontSize":"18"}</math>0.0218 moles

Mass = moles x molar mass = 0.0218 x 46.0 = 1.00 g (an exceptionally large number of molecules in just 1 g)

#### Examiner Tips and Tricks

* When you are completing calculations using Avogadro's constant, you may end up with answers that seem very large or very small - don't automatically assume that they must be wrong
* Remember, Avogadro's constant is a VERY large number:

  + 6.02 x 10<sup>23</sup> or 602 000 000 000 000 000 000 000
* So when you multiply or divide by Avogadro's constant, your answers will, naturally, become very large or very small
