## Titration Calculations

#### Volumetric Analysis

* Volumetric analysis is a process that uses the volume and concentration of one chemical reactant (**standard solution**) to determine the concentration of another unknown solution
* The technique most commonly used is a **titration**
* The volumes are measured using two precise pieces of equipment, a **volumetric**or**graduated pipette**and a **burette**
* Before the titration can be done, the standard solution must be prepared
* Specific apparatus must be used both when preparing the standard solution and when completing the titration, to ensure that volumes are measured precisely

#### Making a Standard Solution

* Chemists routinely prepare solutions needed for analysis, whose concentrations are known precisely
* These solutions are termed **volumetric solutions** or **standard solutions**
* They are made as accurately and precisely as possible using three decimal place balances and volumetric flasks to reduce the impact of measurement uncertainties
* The steps are:

#### Performing the Titration

* The key piece of equipment used in the titration is the burette
* **Burettes** are usually marked to a precision of 0.10 cm3

  + Since they are analogue instruments, the uncertainty is recorded to **half** the smallest marking, in other words to ±0.05 cm3
* The **end point** or **equivalence point** occurs when the two solutions have reacted completely and is shown with the use of an **indicator**

***The steps in a titration***

* A white tile is placed under the conical flask while the titration is performed, to make it easier to see the colour change

***The steps in a titration***

* The steps in a titration are:

  + Measuring a known volume (usually 20 or 25 cm3) of one of the solutions with a volumetric pipette and placing it into a conical flask
  + The other solution is placed in the burette

    - To start with, the burette will usually be filled to 0.00 cm3
  + A few drops of the indicator are added to the solution in the conical flask
  + The tap on the burette is carefully opened and the solution added, portion by portion, to the conical flask until the indicator starts to change colour
  + As you start getting near to the end point, the flow of the burette should be slowed right down so that the solution is added dropwise

    - You should be able to close the tap on the burette after one drop has caused the colour change
  + Multiple runs are carried out until **concordant** results are obtained

    - Concordant results are within 0.1 cm3 of each other

#### Recording and processing titration results

* Both the initial and final burette readings should be recorded and shown to a precision of  ±0.05 cm3, the same as the uncertainty

![Titration results, downloadable IB Chemistry revision notes](1.2.9-Titration-results.png)

***A typical layout and set of titration results***

* The volume delivered (titre) is calculated and recorded to an uncertainty of ±0.10 cm3

  + The uncertainty is doubled, because two burette readings are made to obtain the titre (V final – V initial), following the rules for propagation of uncertainties
* **Concordant**results are then averaged, and non-concordant results are discarded
* The appropriate calculations are then done

#### Volumes & concentrations of solutions

* The **concentration** of a solution is the amount of **solute** dissolved in a **solvent** to make 1 dm3 of  **solution**

  + The solute is the substance that dissolves in a solvent to form a solution
  + The solvent is often water

* A **concentrated** solution is a solution that has a **high** concentration of solute
* A **dilute** solution is a solution with a **low** concentration of solute
* When carrying out calculations involve concentrations in mol dm-3 the following points need to be considered:

  + Change mass in grams to **moles**
  + Change cm3 to dm3
* To calculate the **mass** of a substance present in solution of known **concentration and volume**:

  + Rearrange the concentration equation

**number of moles (mol) = concentration (mol dm****-3****) x volume (dm****3****)**

* Multiply the moles of solute by its molar mass

**mass of solute (g) = number of moles (mol) x molar mass (g mol****-1****)**

#### Worked Example

**Neutralisation calculation** 25.0 cm3 of 0.050 mol dm-3 sodium carbonate was completely neutralised by 20.00 cm3  of dilute hydrochloric acid.Calculate the concentration in mol dm-3 of hydrochloric acid.

**Answer**

**Step 1:** Write the balanced symbol equation

**Na****2****CO****3** **+  2HCl  →  2NaCl  +  H****2****O  +  CO****2**

**Step 2:** Calculate the amount, in moles, of sodium carbonate reacted by rearranging the equation for amount of substance (mol) and dividing the volume by 1000 to convert cm3 to dm3

* Amount (Na2CO3) = 0.025 dm3 x 0.050 mol dm-3 = 0.00125 mol

**Step 3:** Calculate the moles of hydrochloric acid required using the reaction’s stoichiometry

* 1 mol of Na2CO3 reacts with 2 mol of HCl, so the molar ratio is 1 : 2

  + Therefore 0.00125 moles of Na2CO3 react with 0.00250 moles of HCl

**Step 4:** Calculate the concentration, in mol dm-3, of hydrochloric acid

* [HCl] ![equals fraction numerator amount space left parenthesis mol right parenthesis over denominator volume space left parenthesis dm cubed right parenthesis end fraction equals fraction numerator
