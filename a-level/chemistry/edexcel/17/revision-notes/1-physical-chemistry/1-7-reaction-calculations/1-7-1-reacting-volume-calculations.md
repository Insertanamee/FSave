Reacting Volume Calculations
----------------------------

* Reacting volume calculations are commonly associated with the reactions of gases
* All gases occupy the same volume under the same conditions

  + At room temperature and pressure (r.t.p.), the <b>molar gas volume</b> of any gas is 24.0 dm<sup>3</sup>

    - Room temperature and pressure are 293 K / 20 <sup>o</sup>C and 101.3 kPa respectively
  + At standard temperature and pressure (s.t.p.), the molar gas volume of any gas is 22.4 dm<sup>3</sup>

    - Standard temperature and pressure are 273 K / 0 <sup>o</sup>C and 101.3 kPa respectively
* The equation to calculate the number of moles for any volume of gas is:

Number of moles = <math>Volume of gas (dm3)Molar gas volume (dm3){"language":"en","fontFamily":"Times New Roman","fontSize":"18"}</math>

#### Worked Example

1. Room temperature and pressure
2. Standard temperature and pressure

* Volumes of gas can also be calculated using

  + Number of moles calculations
  + Volume calculations
* This can help determine the size of the equipment that you use in an experiment

#### Worked Example

<b>Calculating gas volumes from moles</b>

Calculate the volume of gas produced when 1.50 g of sodium reacts with water at standard temperature and pressure.

<b>Answer</b>

<b>Step 1:</b> Write the balanced equation for the reaction

* 2Na (s) + H<sub>2</sub>O (l) → 2NaOH (aq) + H<sub>2</sub> (g)

<b>Step 2: </b>Calculate the number of moles of sodium

* Number of moles <math>=mass (g)molar mass (g mol-1)=1.523.0={"language":"en","fontFamily":"Times New Roman","fontSize":"18"}</math>0.0652 moles (to 3s.f.)

<b>Step 3: </b>Use the stoichiometry of the equation to calculate the number of moles of hydrogen

* The stoichiometric ratio of Na : H<sub>2</sub> is 2 : 1

  + Therefore, the number of moles of hydrogen is <math>0.06522={"language":"en","fontFamily":"Times New Roman","fontSize":"18"}</math>0.0326 moles

<b>Step 4:</b> Calculate the volume of hydrogen gas evolved

* Volume of gas = number of moles x molar gas volume

  + Volume of gas = 0.0326 x 22.4 = 0.730 dm<sup>3</sup> (to 3s.f.)

#### Worked Example

<b>Calculating gas volumes from other volumes</b>

Calculate the total volume of gas produced when 6.50 dm<sup>3</sup> of propane combusts completely

<b>Answer</b>

<b>Step 1: </b>Write the balanced equation for the reaction

* C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub> (g) + 5O<sub>2</sub> (g) → 3CO<sub>2</sub> (g) + 4H<sub>2</sub>O (g)

<b>Step 2:</b> Determine the number of moles of gas produced

* One mole of propane produces 3 moles of carbon dioxide and 4 moles of water

  + Therefore, one mole of propane produces a total of 7 moles of gas

<b>Step 3:</b> Calculate the volume of gas that is produced

* 6.50 dm<sup>3</sup> of propane will produce 7 x 6.50 dm<sup>3</sup> of gas = 45.5 dm<sup>3</sup> gas

#### Kinetic theory of gases

* <b>The kinetic theory of gases </b>states that molecules in gases are constantly moving
* The theory makes the following assumptions:

  + That gas molecules are moving very fast and randomly
  + That molecules hardly have any volume
  + That gas molecules do not attract or repel each other (<b>no</b> <b>intermolecular forces</b>)
  + No kinetic energy is lost when the gas molecules collide with each other (<b>elastic collisions</b>)
  + The temperature of the gas is related to the average kinetic energy of the molecules
* Gases that follow the kinetic theory of gases are called <b>ideal gases</b>
* However, in reality gases do not fit this description exactly <b>but</b> may come very close and are called <b>real gases</b>

#### Ideal gas equation

* The <b>ideal gas equation </b>shows the relationship between pressure, volume, temperature and number of moles of gas of an ideal gas:

#### PV = nRT

* <i>P</i> = pressure (pascals, Pa)

  + <i>V</i> = volume (m<sup>3</sup>)
  + <i>n</i> = number of moles of gas (mol)
  + <i>R</i> = gas constant (8.31 J K<sup>-1</sup> mol<sup>-1</sup>)
  + <i>T</i> = temperature (kelvin, K)

#### Worked Example

<b>Calculating the volume of a gas</b>

Calculate the volume occupied by 0.781 mol of oxygen at a pressure of 220 kPa and a temperature of 21 °C

<b>Answer</b>

<b>Step 1: </b>Rearrange the ideal gas equation to find volume of gas

<i>V</i> = <math>nRTP{"language":"en","fontFamily":"Times New Roman","fontSize":"18"}</math>

<b>Step 2: </b>Calculate the volume the oxygen gas occupies

* <i>P</i> = 220 kPa = 220 000 Pa

  + <i>n</i> = 0.781 mol
  + <i>R</i> = 8.31 J K<sup>-1</sup> mol<sup>-1</sup>
  + <i>T</i> = 21 <sup>o</sup>C = 294 K

<i>V </i><math>=0.781 ×8.31×294220000= 0.00867 m3 = 8.67 dm3{"language":"en","fontFamily":"Times New Roman","fontSize":"18"}</math>

#### Worked Example

<b>Calculating the molar mass of a gas</b>

A flask of volume 1000 cm<sup>3</sup> contains 6.39 g of a gas. The pressure in the flask was 300 kPa and the temperature was 23 °C.

Calculate the relative molecular mass of the gas.

<b>Answer</b>

<b>Step 1: </b>Rearrange the ideal gas equation to find the number of moles of gas

#### Examiner Tips and Tricks

To calculate the temperature in <b>Kelvin</b>, add 273 to the Celsius temperature, e.g. 100 <sup>o</sup>C is 373 Kelvin.

You must be able to rearrange the ideal gas equation to work out all parts of it.

The <b>units</b> are incredibly important in this equation - make sure you know what units you should use, and do the necessary conversions when doing your calculations!
