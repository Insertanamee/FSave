## Reactions with Hydroxide & Ammonia

* When transition metal ions in aqueous solution react with aqueous sodium hydroxide and aqueous ammonia they form precipitates
* However some of these precipitates will dissolve in an excess of sodium hydroxide or ammonia to form complex ions in solution

* Solutions of metal aqua ions react as​ acids ​with aqueous ammonia, whilst some react further with excess ammonia​
* Initially, ammonia acts as a​ base​ to remove one H+ ion per ammonia molecule used
* With excess ammonia, some metal ions undergo ​ ligand substitution ​with NH3

#### Examiner Tips and Tricks

It is easiest to remember the formulas of the precipitates by remembering that the number of OH- ions substituted is the same as the value of the charge on the initial ion

## Ionic Equations

#### Reaction with limited OH- and limited NH3

* The bases OH- and ammonia when in limited amounts form the same hydroxide precipitates.
* They form in deprotonation acid-base reactions
* For example, consider the reaction that occurs when aqueous sodium hydroxide is added to copper(II) sulfate solution

**[Cu(H****2****O)****6****]****2+****(aq) + 2OH****-****(aq) → [Cu(H****2****O)****4****(OH)****2****] (s) + 2H****2****O (l)**

* This seems like a ligand substitution reaction - two hydroxide ions replacing two water molecules
* However this is actually a deprotonation reaction - two hydroxide ions removing hydrogen ions from two of the water ligands converting them into water molecules

  + The two ligands that have lost hydrogen ions are now hydroxide ligands

#### Reaction with excess OH-

* From above, we have seen how hydrated transition metal ions can be deprotonated by adding a base such as aqueous sodium hydroxide to form a metal hydroxide precipitate
* For example

**[Cr(H****2****O)****6****]****3+****(aq) + 3OH****-****(aq) → [Cr(H****2****O)****3****(OH)****3****] (s) +3H****2****O (l)**

* When an excess of sodium hydroxide is added further deprotonation takes place

**[Cr(H****2****O)****3****(OH)****3****] (s) + 3OH****-****(aq) → [Cr(OH)****6****]****3-****(aq) + 3H****2****O (l)**

* In this reaction, chromium(III) hydroxide acts as an acid, as it is reacting with a base
* Chromium(III) hydroxide can also act as a base because it can react with acids as follows

**[Cr(H****2****O)****3****(OH)****3****] (s) + 3H****+****(aq) → [Cr(H****2****O)****6****]****3+** **(aq)**

* A metal hydroxide that can act as both an acid and a base is called an amphoteric hydroxide

  + This is an example of amphoteric behaviour

#### Reaction with excess NH3

* With excess NH3 ligand substitution reactions occur with Cu, Co and Cr and their precipitates dissolve
* The ligands NH3 and H2O are similar in size and are uncharged
* Ligand exchange occurs without a change of co-ordination number for Co and Cr
* For example, when excess aqueous ammonia is added to a copper(II) hydroxide precipitate it dissolves forming a deep blue solution

**[Cu(H****2****O)****4****(OH)****2****] (s) + 4NH****3****(aq) → [Cu(NH****3****)****4****(H****2****O)****2****]****2+****(aq) + 2H****2****O (l) + 2OH****-** **(aq)**

* This is a ligand substitution - four ammonia molecules replace two water molecules and two hydroxide ions
* In these reactions, NH3 is acting as a Lewis base donating an electron pair

#### Reaction with Cl-

* The chloride ligand undergoes substitution reactions with Cu, Co and Fe(III)
* The Cl– ligand is much larger in size than H2O and is charged
* This means that there is a change in:

  + Coordination number from 6 to 4
  + Shape from octahedral to tetrahedral
  + The overall charge on the complex
* For example, when excess / concentrated hydrochloric acid is added to a copper(II) hydroxide precipitate it forms a yellow solution

**[Cu(H****2****O)****6****]****2+** **(aq) + 4Cl****–** **(aq) → [CuCl****4****]****2–** **(aq) + 6H****2****O (l)**

* This is a ligand substitution - four chloride ions replace six water molecules
* In these reactions, Cl**–** is acting as a Lewis base donating an electron pair
* Similar reactions occur with:

  + Pink [Co(H2O)6]2+ (aq) forming blue [CoCl4]2– (aq)
  + Yellow [Fe(H2O)6]3+ (aq) forming orange [FeCl4]– (aq)
