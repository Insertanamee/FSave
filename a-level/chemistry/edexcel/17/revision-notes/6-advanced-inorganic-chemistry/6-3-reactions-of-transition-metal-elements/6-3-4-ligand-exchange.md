## Ligand Exchange

* **Ligand exchange**(or **ligand** **substitution**) is when one **ligand** in a complex is replaced by another
* Ligand exchange forms a new complex that is **more stable** than the original one
* The ligands in the original complex can be **partially** or **entirely** substituted by others
* The complex ion can change its charge or remain the same depending on the ligand involved
* There are no changes in coordination number, or the geometry of the complex, if the ligands are of a**similar** **size**
* But, if the ligands are of a **different size**, for example water ligands and chloride ligands, then a change in coordination number and the geometry of the complex will occur

* Addition of a high concentration of chloride ions (from conc HCl or saturated NaCl) to an aqueous ion leads to a ligand substitution reaction.
* The Cl- ligand is **larger** than the uncharged H2O and NH3 ligands so therefore ligand exchange can involve a change of co-ordination number
* For example when concentrated hydrochloric acid is added slowly and continuously to a copper(II) sulfate solution the colour changes from blue to green then finally yellow
* The equation for this reaction is

**[Cu(H****2****O)****6****]****2+****(aq) + 4Cl****-****(aq) ⇌ [CuCl****4****]****2-****(aq) + 6H****2****O (l)**

* We can see that all six water ligands have been replaced by four chloride ions
* This reaction involves a change in coordination number from 6 to 4
* Note that despite the charge on the complex changing from +2 to -2, there has been no change in oxidation number of the copper
* We can also see that this reaction is reversible, which helps to explain the observed colour change

  + The hexaaquacopper(II) ion is blue
  + The tetrachlorocuprate(II) ion is yellow
  + The green colour is due to a mixture of the blue and yellow complex ions
* A similar reaction also takes place with cobalt resulting in a blue solution and a change in coordination number from 6 to 4

**[Co(H****2****O)****6****]****2+****(aq) + 4Cl****-****(aq) ⇌ [CoCl****4****]****2-****(aq) + 6H****2****O (l)**

#### Examiner Tips and Tricks

**Be careful**: If solid copper chloride (or any other metal) is dissolved in water it forms the aqueous [Cu(H2O)6]2+ complex and not the chloride [CuCl4 ]2- complex

## The Chelate Effect & Stability

* The replacement of monodentate ligands with bidentate and multidentate ligands in complex ions is called the **chelate effect**
* It is an energetically favourable reaction, meaning that **Δ*****G*****ꝋ** is negative
* The driving force behind the reaction is entropy
* The Gibbs equation reminds us of the link between enthalpy and entropy:

**Δ*****G*****ꝋ****= Δ*****H******reaction*****ꝋ****– TΔ*****S******system*****ꝋ**

* Reactions in solution between aqueous ions usually come with relatively small enthalpy changes
* However, the entropy changes are always positive in chelation because the reactions produce a net increase in the number of particles
* A small enthalpy change and relative large positive entropy change generally ensures that the overall free energy change is negative
* For example, when EDTA chelates with aqueous cobalt(II) two reactants becomes seven product species

**[Co(H****2****O)****6****]****2+****(aq) + EDTA****4-****(aq) → [CoEDTA]****2-****(aq) + 6H****2****O****(l)**
