## Disproportionation & Electrode Potential

* A **disproportionation** reaction is where one element in a chemical is simultaneously reduced and oxidised, e.g.

2Cu+ (aq) → Cu2+ (aq) + Cu (s)

* Standard electrode potentials can be used to explain disproportionation reactions

1. Cu2+ (aq) + e– ⇌ Cu+ (aq)   *E**θ* = +0.15 V

   * Cu+ (aq) + e– ⇌ Cu (s)  *E**θ* = +0.52 V
   * The electrode potential value for equation 1 is more negative, therefore, this reaction will be the oxidation reaction and proceed to the left
   * The electrode potential value for equation 2 is more positive, therefore, this reaction will be the reduction reaction and proceed to the right

     + You now have:

Cu+ (aq) ⇌ Cu2+ (aq) + e–

    Cu+ (aq) + e– ⇌ Cu (s)

* Combining these two equations agrees that the overall equation is possible

2Cu+ (aq) → Cu2+ (aq) + Cu (s)
