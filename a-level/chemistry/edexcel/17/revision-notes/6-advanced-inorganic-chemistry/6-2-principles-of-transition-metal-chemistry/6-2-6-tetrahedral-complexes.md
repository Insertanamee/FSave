## Tetrahedral Complexes

* When there are **four coordinate bonds**the complexes often have a **tetrahedral**shape

  + Complexes with four **chloride** **ions** most commonly adopt this geometry
  + Chloride ligands are large, so only four will fit around the central metal ion
* The bond angles in tetrahedral complexes are 109.5o
