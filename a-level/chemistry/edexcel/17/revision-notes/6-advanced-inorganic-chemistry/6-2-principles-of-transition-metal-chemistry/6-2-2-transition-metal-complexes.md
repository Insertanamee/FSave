## Transition Metal Complexes

* Transition element ions can form complexes which consist of a **central metal ion** and **ligands**
* A ligand is a molecule or ion that forms a co-ordinate bond with a transition metal by donating a pair of electrons to the bond

  + This is the definition of a Lewis base - electron pair donor
* This means ligands have a negative charge or a lone pair of electrons capable of being donated

  + This definition may seem familiar: a ligand is the same as a **nucleophile**
* Different**ligands** can form different numbers of dative bonds to the central metal ion in a complex

  + Some ligands can form **one** dative bond to the central metal ion
  + Other ligands can form **two** dative bonds, and some can form **multiple** dative bonds
* **Co-ordination number** is number of co-ordinate bonds to the central metal atom or ion

#### Common Ligands

* Water molecules frequently act as ligands. Each water molecule makes a single bond with the metal ion using one of the lone pairs on the oxygen atom
* The lone pair is donated to the partially filled d-subshell of the transition metal ion

#### Representing complex ions

* Square brackets are used to group together the ligands and metal ion in a representation of the geometrical arrangement
* The overall charge on the complex ion is the sum of the oxidation states of all the species present
* If the ligands are neutral then the overall charge will be the same as the oxidation state of the metal ion

#### Naming complexes

* Complexes are named in the following way
* If the overall ion is a cation then the nomenclature is:

**Prefix for number of ligands/ligand name/element/oxidation number**

* The prefixes are the same ones used in organic chemistry: di, tetra, hexa for 2, 4 & 6 respectively (3 & 5 are rarely encountered except in mixed ligand complexes)
* If the overall ion is an anion, the name of element is modified to have the name ending 'ate' and sometimes Latin word stems are used
* **tetrachlorcuprate(II)**

  + **hexaaquairon(II)**
  + **hexaamminecobalt(II)**
  + **tetracyanonickelate(II)**Using the examples in the illustration above, the names are:
* Notice in these examples that

  + cuprate( Latin - cuprum) and nickelate are used in place of copper and nickel as they are anions
  + Ammonia takes the prefix ammine as a ligand, which is spelt with a double 'm' unlike the functional group amine
