## Coloured Ions

#### Perception of colour

* Most transition metal compounds appear coloured. This is because they absorb energy corresponding to certain parts of the visible **electromagnetic spectrum**
* The colour that is seen is made up of the parts of the visible spectrum that aren’t absorbed
* For example, a green compound will absorb all frequencies of the spectrum apart from green light, which is transmitted
* The colours absorbed are **complementary** to the colour observed

***The colour wheel showing complementary colours in the visible light region of the electromagnetic spectrum***

* Complementary colours are any two colours which are directly opposite each other in the colour wheel

  + For example, the complementary colour of red is green and the complementary colours of red-violet are yellow-green

#### Splitting of 3d energy levels

* In a transition metal atom, the five orbitals that make up the d-subshell all have the same energy.
* Ions that have completely filled 3d energy levels (such as Zn2+) and ions that have no electrons in their 3d subshells (such as Sc3+) are not coloured
* Transition metals have a partially filled 3d energy level
* When ligands attach to the central metal ion the energy level splits into two levels with slightly different energies

  + If one of the electrons in the lower energy level absorbs energy from the visible spectrum it can move to the higher energy level
  + This process is known as **promotion / excitation**
* The amount of energy absorbed depends on the difference between the energy levels

  + A larger energy difference means the electron absorbs more energy
* The amount of energy gained by the electron is directly proportional to the frequency of the absorbed light and inversely proportional to the wavelength

***Upon bonding to ligands, the d orbitals of the transition element ion split into sets of orbitals with different energies***

## Changes in Colour

The size of the splitting energy Δ*E* in the d-orbitals is influenced by the following four factors:

* **The size and type of ligands**
* **The nuclear charge and identity of the metal ion**
* **The oxidation state of the metal**
* **The shape of the complex**

***The large variety of coloured compounds is a defining characteristic of transition metals***

#### Size and type of ligand

* The nature of the ligand influences the strength of the interaction between ligand and central metal ion
* Ligands vary in their charge density
* The greater the charge density; the more strongly the ligand interacts with the metal ion causing greater splitting of the d-orbitals
* The greater the splitting, the more energy is needed to promote an electron to the higher group of orbitals
* Therefore, the further it is shifted towards the region of the spectrum where it absorbs higher energy

  + As splitting increases, the light absorbed will shift away from the red end of the spectrum (longer wavelengths), towards the yellow end (shorter wavelengths)

* As a result, a different colour of light is absorbed by the complex solution and a different **complementary colour** is observed
* This means that complexes with the same **transition elements** **ions,** but **different** **ligands,**can have different colours

  + For example, the [Cu(H2O)6]2+ complex has a **light blue** colour
  + Whereas the [Cu(NH3)4(H2O)2]2+ has a **dark blue** colour despite the copper(II) ion having an oxidation state of +2 in both complexes

***Ligand exchange of the water ligands by ammonia ligands causes a change in colour of the copper(II) complex solution***

#### Oxidation number

* When the same metal has a higher oxidation number that will also create a stronger interaction with the ligands
* If you compare iron(II) and iron (III):

  + [Fe(H2O)6]2+absorbs in the red region and appears green
  + But, [Fe(H2O)6]3+absorbs in blue region and appears orange

#### Coordination number

* The change of colour in a complex is also partly due to the change in coordination number and geometry of the complex ion
* The splitting energy, Δ*E*, of the d-orbitals is affected by the relative orientation of the ligand as well as the d-orbitals
* Changing the coordination number generally involves changing the ligand as well, so it is a combination of these factors that alters the strength of the interactions
