## Monodentate ligands

* **Monodentate** ligands can form only **one**dative bond to the central metal ion
* This is because they have a single lone pair of electrons to form a dative bond with the metal ion
* Examples of monodentate ligands are:

  + Water (H2O) molecules
  + Ammonia (NH3) molecules
  + Chloride (Cl–) ions
  + Cyanide (CN–) ions

## Bidentate & Multidentate Ligands

#### Bidentate Ligands

* **Bidentate** ligands can each form **two**dative bonds to the central metal ion
* This is because each ligand contains **two**atoms with lone pairs of electrons
* Examples of bidentate ligands are:

  + 1,2-diaminoethane (H2NCH2CH2NH2) which is also written as **‘en’**
  + Ethanedioate ion (C2O42-) which is sometimes written as **‘ox’**

#### Multidentate Ligands

* Some ligands contain more than two atoms with lone pairs of electrons
* These ligands can form more than two dative bonds to the and are said to be **multidentate** ligands
* An example of a multidentate ligand is EDTA4-, which is a **hexadentate**ligand as it forms 6 dative covalent bonds to the central metal ion
