## Properties of Catalysts

* Transition metals are often used as catalysts in the elemental form or as compounds
* The ability of transition metals to form more than one stable oxidation state means that they can accept and lose electrons easily
* This enables them to catalyse certain redox reactions. They can be readily oxidised and reduced again, or reduced and then oxidised again, as a consequence of having a number of different oxidation states of similar stability
* There are two types of catalyst:

  + A **heterogeneous** catalyst is in a different physical state (phase) from the reactants

    - The reaction occurs at active sites on the surface of the catalyst
    - An example is the use of iron, Fe, in the Haber process for making ammonia

**N****2****(g) + 3H****2****(g) ⇌ 2NH****3****(g)**

* A**homogeneous** catalyst is in the same physical state (phase) as the reactants
