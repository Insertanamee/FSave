<b>collection and analysis of evidence</b> from a potential crime scene e.g. the scene at which a dead body is found</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Determining the <b>time of death</b> (TOD) of a body is a very important component of <b>forensic science</b></p><ul><li><p>The TOD can be used during a police investigation to provide information about the <b>circumstances surrounding the death </b>of a person</p></li></ul></li><li><p>In order to accurately estimate TOD, there are <b>several factors</b> that must be established</p><ul><li><p>Extent of decomposition</p></li><li><p>Stage of succession</p></li><li><p>Forensic entomology</p></li><li><p>Body temperature of the deceased</p></li><li><p>The degree of muscle contraction</p></li></ul></li></ul><h4

material and waste products are digested, producing carbon dioxide, water and inorganic ions" data-title="Decomposition" data-toggle="popover" data-type="definition">decomposition</span> begins soon after death</p><ul><li><p>Decomposition is carried out by organisms known as<b> decomposers</b> e.g. bacteria and fungi</p><ul><li><p>Enzymes secreted from the cells of these organisms break down biological molecules in dead tissue</p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p>The time since death can often be established visually by looking at the appearance of a body that is decomposing</p><ul><li><p>Decomposers break down <b>cells and tissues </b>over the course of a few days</p><ul><li><p>At this stage in decomposition the appearance of the skin can be a helpful indication of time since death; <b>skin will often appear greenish in colour</b></p></li></ul></li><li><p>The next stage of decomposition involves the <b>breakdown of tissues and organs</b> by micro-organisms over the course of a few days or weeks</p><ul><li><p>This process produces gases, such as methane, which will lead to <b>bloating</b> </p></li><li><p>The <b>skin will blister and fall off</b> the rest of the body</p></li></ul></li><li><p>A few <b>weeks after death </b>the remains of the soft tissues will <b>turn to liquid</b> which becomes visible as it <b>leaves the body</b></p></li><li><p>This process will continue over the course of <b>months or years </b>until only a <b>skeleton</b> remain</p></li><li><p>After a <b>few decades or centuries,</b> the skeleton will <b>disintegrate</b> until nothing remains</p></li></ul></li><li><p>The rate of decomposition will be affected by factors such as <b>temperature </b>and <b>availability of oxygen</b></p><ul><li><p>Decomposition would be slower in <span class="popovers" data-content="In the absence of oxygen." data-title="Anaerobic" data-toggle="popover"

succession</h4><ul><li><p>Succession refers to the <b>change in the types of organisms</b> found in a habitat over time</p><ul><li><p>This is often an ecology term that is applied to a habitat such as a pond or woodland, but in this case the <b>habitat is the dead body</b></p><ul><li><p>The difference between succession in ecology and in forensics is that in an ecosystem the early <span class="popovers" data-content="A species that can colonise bare rock or ground." data-title="Pioneer Species" data-toggle="popover" data-type="definition">pioneer species</span> are out-competed and disappear as the system matures, while in a dead body <b>all of the newly arriving species remain as decomposition progresses</b></p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p>The <b>stage of succession</b> of a body can provide information about the estimated TOD</p></li><li><p><b>Above ground </b>the body would undergo the following stages of succession</p><ul><li><p><b>Bacteria</b> will be found in and on the dead body immediately after TOD</p></li><li><p>As tissue decomposition sets in it creates ideal conditions for <b>flies</b> to lay eggs and their <b>larvae</b> to hatch</p></li><li><p>As more soft tissue is consumed by the fly larvae it creates favourable conditions for <b>beetles</b> to establish </p></li><li><p>When <b>tissue dries out</b> over time <b>flies will leave</b> the body as they prefer a moisture-rich environment</p></li><li><p><b>Beetles</b>, however, can decompose dry tissue so they <b>will remain </b>on the body</p></li><li><p>Once all tissues have been decomposed most organisms will leave the body</p></li></ul></li><li><p>These <b>succession stages will differ</b> depending on where the body is located as the <b>accessibility to insects</b> and <b>availability of oxygen</b> will be affected e.g.</p><ul><li><p>Buried in soil</p></li><li><p>Buried in a coffin</p></li><li><p>Under water</p></li></ul></li></ul><h4 id="forensic-entomology">Forensic entomology</h4><ul><li><p>A dead body provides an ideal habitat for many <b>species of insects;</b> the study of these insect colonies is known as <b>forensic entomology</b></p></li><li><p><b>Different insect species </b>will colonise a body at different times after death, providing information about the TOD</p><ul><li><p>Flies will be found on the body within a few hours after death, while beetles will only colonise the body later</p></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><p>Another clue that insects can provide is the <b>stage of life cycle </b>they are at</p><ul><li><p>E.g. blowfly eggs will hatch after about 24 hours so if larvae are present on the body it indicates that the person died more than 24 hours ago</p><ul><li><p>Other insects have longer life cycles, so if <b>only</b> blowfly larvae are found it indicates that <b>only</b> 24 hours has passed since TOD</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Factors that might affect the<b> progression of insect life cycles </b>include</p><ul><li><p>Drugs that may be present in the body</p></li><li><p>Humidity of the surroundings</p></li><li><p>Oxygen availability</p></li><li><p>Temperature </p></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h4 id="body-temperature">Body temperature</h4><ul><li><p>Respiration and other metabolic processes <b>produce heat </b>in living organisms</p><ul><li><p>This heat is necessary for maintaining our body temperature at around <b>37 °C</b> during life</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Once a person dies <b>metabolic reactions</b> will eventually <b>come to an end</b></p><ul><li><p>Since no more heat is produced the <b>body temperature</b> <b>drops</b> until it reaches the temperature of the surrounding environment</p></li><li><p>This process of cooling is known as <i><b>algor mortis</b></i></p></li></ul></li><li><p>Body temperature decreases by <b>1.5</b>-<b>2.0 °C</b> <b>per hour</b>, therefore providing forensic scientists with a way to determine the TOD based on the temperature of the body</p></li><li><p>Certain conditions will affect the rate at which body heat is lost
