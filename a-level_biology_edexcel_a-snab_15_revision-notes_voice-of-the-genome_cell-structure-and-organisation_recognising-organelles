id="recognising-organelles-from-electron-microscope-images">Recognising Organelles from Electron Microscope Images</h2><ul><li><p>Electron microscopes can produce highly detailed images of animal and plant cells</p></li><li><p>This is because they have a higher <b>resolution</b>, or <b>resolving power</b>, than a light microscope</p><ul><li><p><b>Resolution</b> is the ability to distinguish between two separate points</p></li><li><p>If two separate points cannot be resolved they will be observed as one point, producing an unclear image</p></li><li><p>Magnification is limited by the resolution of a microscope; there is no point in magnifying an image many times if the resulting image is unclear</p></li></ul></li><li><p>The resolution of a light microscope is <b>limited by the wavelength of light</b></p><ul><li><p>The wavelength of light is too long to provide a high resolution</p></li></ul></li><li><p><b>Electron microscopes</b> have a much higher resolution than a light microscope as electrons have a much smaller wavelength than visible light</p><ul><li><p>This means that electron microscopes can distinguish between two separate points that are much closer together than the points that can be distinguished by a light microscope</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Electron microscopes are therefore capable of<b> higher magnification</b> before the image becomes unclear</p></li><li><p>Some of the key cellular structures within animal and plant cells are visible within electron micrographs</p><ul><li><p>Electron micrographs are the images produced by electron microscopes</p></li></ul></li><li><p><b>Electron microscopes</b>, both scanning and transmission, are used for specimens <b>larger than 0.5 nm</b></p><ul><li><p>Electron microscopes fire a <b>beam of electrons</b> at or through a specimen</p></li><li><p>The electrons are picked up by an electromagnetic lens which then generates an image</p></li><li><p>Electron microscopes are useful for looking at <b>organelles, viruses,</b> and <b>DNA, </b>as well as looking at whole cells in more detail</p></li><li><p>Electron microscopy requires the specimen to be <b>dead</b> which can provide a <b>snapshot</b> in time of what is occurring in a cell, e.g. DNA can be seen replicating and chromosome position within the stages of mitosis are visible</p></li></ul></li></ul><p

taken with a TEM and if the image appears 3D then an SEM would have been used. </p></div></div></div></div>
