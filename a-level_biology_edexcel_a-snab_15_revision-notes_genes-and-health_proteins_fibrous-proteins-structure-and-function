of polypeptide chains that have cross-linkages due to hydrogen bonds</p></li><li><p>These proteins have little or no tertiary structure</p></li><li><p>Fibrous proteins have a limited number of amino acids with the sequence usually being highly repetitive</p></li><li><p>The highly repetitive sequence creates <b>very organised structures</b> </p></li></ul><h4 id="function">Function</h4><ul><li><p>Due to a large number of <b>hydrophobic R groups</b>, fibrous proteins are <b>insoluble</b> in water</p></li><li><p>Fibrous proteins are <b>strong</b> and this, along with their insolubility property, makes fibrous proteins very suitable for <b>structural roles</b></p></li><li><p>Examples of fibrous proteins:</p><ul><li><p><b>Keratin</b> makes up hair, nails, horns and feathers (it is a very tough fibrous protein)</p></li><li><p><b>Elastin</b> is found in connective tissue, tendons, skin and bone (it can stretch and then return to its original shape)</p></li><li><p><b>Collagen</b> is a connective tissue found in skin, tendons and ligaments</p></li></ul></li></ul><div class="mb-5" data-type="image"><img alt="Globular and Fibrous"
