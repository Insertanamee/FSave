are a common occurrence since the body is placed <b>under stress</b> when participating in sporting activities</p></li><li><p>Some of these injuries can result in <b>permanent damage</b>, but with the correct treatment it is possible to make a full recovery from sports injuries</p></li><li><p><b>Advances in medical technology</b> has enabled professional athletes to recover from injuries that previously may have ended their career</p></li><li><p><b>Keyhole surgery </b>is one example of the medical advances that have been made</p><ul><li><p>It is a <b>less invasive </b>procedure as only <b>small incisions</b> are made in the skin</p></li><li><p>A <b>small video camera</b> is inserted into the incision, along with <b>specialised medical instruments</b> with which to perform the surgery</p></li><li><p>There are multiple <b>advantages of keyhole surgery </b>compared to conventional surgery:</p><ul><li><p><b>Less blood loss</b> and <b>scarring</b> of the skin</p></li><li><p><b>Less pain</b> after surgery and a <b>quicker recovery</b></p></li><li><p>This leads to a <b>shorter hospital stay</b> and the patient can <b>quickly return</b> to doing normal activities</p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p>An example of keyhole surgery is fixing a <b>damaged cruciate ligament</b></p><ul><li><p>The cruciate ligaments are found in the <b>middle of the knee</b> and it <b>connects</b> the <b>thigh bone</b> to the <b>lower leg bone</b></p></li><li><p>The damaged ligament can be removed and <b>replaced by a graft</b> from another tendon in the patient's leg or from a donor's tendon</p></li></ul></li></ul><h4 id="prostheses">Prostheses</h4><ul><li><p>Injuries may sometimes result in people <b>losing or damaging a body part</b> to the extent that they can no longer use it</p></li><li><p>In some cases, a person may be born <b>without</b> certain body parts</p></li><li><p>In both these cases, the missing or damaged body part may be replaced with an <b>artificial version</b> called a <b>prosthesis</b></p><ul><li><p>They may replace <b>entire limbs</b> (e.g. legs or hands) or <b>parts of limbs</b> (e.g. hip or knee joints)</p></li><li><p>Some prostheses may be <b>connected to electronic devices</b> that can 'read' information form the nervous system in order to operate the body part (e.g. hand prostheses enabling the user to move the fingers)</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Prostheses enables individuals to <b>participate in sport again,</b> even after serious injuries</p></li><li><p>An example of the use of a prosthesis is <b>replacing a damaged knee joint</b></p><ul><li><p>The damaged cartilage and bone is replaced by a <b>metal device</b> on both long bones to create a smooth surface for articulation</p></li><li><p>A plastic spacer is often inserted between the metal ends of the prosthesis to provide <b>cushioning </b>and<b> reduce the impact</b> on the knee</p></li><li><p>The knee prosthesis enables those with serious knee injuries to be <b>more mobile</b> and even participate in <b>low-impact sports</b></p></li></ul></li></ul><div class="mb-5" data-type="image"><img alt="knee-prosthesis"
