system is a necessary part of keeping the lungs healthy</p><ul><li><p>It prevents infection by trapping microorganisms</p></li><li><p>This mucus is moved out of the respiratory tract by cilia </p></li></ul></li><li><p>In people with cystic fibrosis, due to the faulty chloride ion channels, the <b>cilia are unable to move</b> as the mucus is so thick and sticky</p></li><li><p>This means microorganisms are not efficiently removed from the lungs and lung infections occur more frequently</p></li><li><p>Mucus builds up in the <b>lungs</b> and can block airways which limits gas exchange</p><ul><li><p>The <b>surface area for gas exchange is reduced</b> which can cause breathing difficulties</p></li></ul></li><li><p><b>Physiotherapy</b> can support people with cystic fibrosis to loosen the mucus in the airways and improve gas exchange</p></li></ul><h4 id="the-digestive-system">The digestive system</h4><ul><li><p>Thick mucus in the digestive system can cause issues because</p><ul><li><p>The tube to the <b>pancreas</b> can become blocked, preventing digestive enzymes from entering the small intestine</p><ul><li><p>Digestion of some food may be reduced and therefore <b>key nutrients may not be made available for absorption</b></p></li></ul></li><li><p>The mucus can cause <b>cysts</b> to grow in the pancreas which <b>inhibit the production of enzymes</b>, further reducing digestion of key nutrients</p></li><li><p>The<b> lining of the intestines </b>is also coated in thick mucus, <b>inhibiting the absorption of nutrients into the blood</b></p></li></ul></li></ul><h4 id="the-reproductive-system">The reproductive system</h4><ul><li><p>Mucus is normally secreted in the reproductive system to prevent infection and regulate the progress of sperm through the reproductive tract after sexual intercourse</p></li><li><p>The mucus in people with cystic fibrosis can cause issues in both men and women</p><ul><li><p>In <b>men</b> the tubes of the testes can become blocked, preventing sperm from reaching the penis</p></li><li><p>In <b>women</b> thickened cervical mucus can prevent sperm reaching the oviduct to fertilise an
