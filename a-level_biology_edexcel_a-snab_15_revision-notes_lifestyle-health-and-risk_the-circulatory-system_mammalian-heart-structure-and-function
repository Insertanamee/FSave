organism, as well as waste materials that need to be removed</p></li><li><p><b>Circulatory systems</b> are described as being either <b>open or closed</b></p><ul><li><p>In a closed circulatory system blood is pumped around the body and is always contained within a network of blood vessels</p></li><li><p>In an open circulatory system the blood, or blood equivalent, is inside the body cavity and bathes the organs</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Circulatory systems can also be either <b>double or single</b></p><ul><li><p>Double circulatory systems have two loops; one to the lungs and one to the body</p></li><li><p>Single circulatory systems have one loop that includes the lungs and the body</p></li></ul></li><li><p><b>Humans have a closed, double circulatory system;</b> in one complete circuit of the body blood passes through the heart twice</p><ul><li><p>The <b>right side</b> of the heart pumps blood <b>deoxygenated</b> blood to the lungs for gas exchange; this is the <b>pulmonary circulatory system</b></p></li><li><p>Blood then returns to the <b>left side</b> of the heart, so that <b>oxygenated</b> blood can be pumped at high pressure around the body; this is the <b>systemic circulatory system</b></p></li></ul></li></ul><h4 id="heart-structure">Heart structure</h4><ul><li><p>The human heart has a mass of around 300 g and is roughly the size of a closed fist</p></li><li><p>The heart is a hollow, muscular organ located in the chest cavity</p></li><li><p>It is protected in the chest cavity by the <b>pericardium</b>, a tough and fibrous sac</p></li><li><p>The heart is divided into four chambers</p><ul><li><p>The two top chambers are <b>atria</b></p></li><li><p>The bottom two chambers are <b>ventricles</b></p></li></ul></li><li><p>The left and right sides of the heart are separated by a wall of muscular tissue called the <b>septum</b></p><ul><li><p>The septum is very important for ensuring blood doesn’t mix between the left and right sides of the heart</p></li></ul></li></ul><div class="mb-5" data-type="image"><img alt="human-heart-structure" class="ContentBlock_figure__6whpf" data-nimg="1" decoding="async" height="921"
