diseases in <b>individuals with different </b><span class="popovers" data-content="The combination of alleles present within the cells of an organism" data-title="Genotype" data-toggle="popover" data-type="definition">genotypes</span></p><ul><li><p>Such drugs can be tested on <b>synthetic tissues</b>; groups of cells <b>cultured in a lab</b> that are <b>genetically identical</b> to certain groups of patients</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Information gathered from genome projects like the Human Genome Project (HGP) can be used to develop <b>genomic medicine, </b>which uses information about the <b>genes </b>to design medical treatments</p><ul><li><p>The HGP involved the <b>sequencing</b> of the entire human <span class="popovers" data-content="The complete set of genetic material present in a cell or an organism." data-title="Genome" data-toggle="popover" data-type="definition">genome</span></p></li><li><p>The information gained during the HGP is stored in <b>databases</b>, within which <b>genes that code for certain proteins can be found and analysed</b></p></li><li><p>Knowing the sequence and structure of proteins involved in disease allows the <b>development of drugs that target specific proteins</b></p><ul><li><p>E.g. if an enzyme is involved with disease, a drug that acts as an <b>enzyme inhibitor</b> can be developed</p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p>By combining information about the genome with other clinical and diagnostic information, patterns can be identified that can help to determine an individual's <b>risk of developing disease</b></p><ul><li><p>Genetic screening allows individuals with a high chance of developing specific diseases to be identified and means that <b>preventative</b> measures can be taken e.g.</p><ul><li><p>Certain genetic mutations are known to increase the risk of an individual developing breast cancer, so those who know that they have such a mutation can have surgery in advance to reduce their risk</p></li><li><p>An individual may be able to make certain life choices regarding diet and lifestyle based on knowledge of their genetic risk of cancers and heart disease</p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p>Doctors can also use an individual's genome to work out <b>how well they might respond</b> to specific treatments, allowing treatments to be selected on the basis of an individual's genotype</p></li></ul><div class="mb-5" data-type="image"><img alt="Bioinformatics" class="ContentBlock_figure__6whpf" data-nimg="1" decoding="async" height="827"
