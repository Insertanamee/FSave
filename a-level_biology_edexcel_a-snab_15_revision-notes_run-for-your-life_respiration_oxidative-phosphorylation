oxidative phosphorylation is the <b>chemiosmotic theory</b></p><ul><li><p>The model states that <b>energy from electrons</b> is passed through a chain of proteins in the membrane, known as the

are then allowed to <b>flow by facilitated diffusion</b> through a channel enzyme called <b>ATP synthase</b> into the matrix</p></li><li><p>The energy of the protons flowing down their concentration gradient is harnessed (a bit like water flowing through a hydroelectric damn) resulting in the <b>phosphorylation of ADP into ATP</b> by ATP synthase</p></li></ul></li></ul><h4

Oxygen acts as the <b>final electron acceptor. </b>Without oxygen the electron transport chain cannot continue as the electrons have nowhere to go. Without oxygen accepting the electrons (and hydrogen ions) the reduced coenzymes NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub> cannot be oxidised to regenerate NAD and FAD, so they can’t be used in further hydrogen transport.</p><p>It is important to use the correct terminology when describing hydrogen; ensure you understand when to use "hydrogen" and when to use "hydrogen ions/protons". </p></div></div></div></div>
