the <b>number of breaths taken in one minute</b> (one breath = taking air in and breathing it back out again)</p></li><li><p><b>Oxygen consumption</b> - this is the <b>volume of oxygen</b> used up by someone <b>in a given time</b></p></li><li><p><b>Respiratory minute ventilation</b> - this is the <b>volume</b> <b>of air</b> that can be breathed <b>in</b> or <b>out</b> in a minute and can be

dioxide in the re-breathed air from getting too high, as this can cause breathing distress</p></li><li><p>As the subject breathes through the spirometer, a <b>trace</b> is drawn on a rotating drum of paper or a <b>graph</b> is formed digitally, which can be viewed on a computer</p></li><li><p>From this trace, the subject's <b>respiratory minute ventilation</b>, <b>tidal volume</b> and <b>breathing
