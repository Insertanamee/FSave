id="disaccharides-function">Disaccharides: Function</h2><ul><li><p>The function of disaccharides is to <b>provide the body with a quick-release source of energy</b></p><ul><li><p>Disaccharides are made up of two sugar molecules so they're easily broken down by enzymes in the digestive system into their respective monosaccharides and then absorbed into the bloodstream</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Due to the presence of a large number of hydroxyl groups, <b>disaccharides are easily soluble in water</b></p><ul><li><p>These hydroxyl groups form hydrogen bonds with the water molecules when dissolved in aqueous solutions</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Just like monosaccharides they are <b>sweet in taste</b></p><ul><li><p>Sucrose, also known as table sugar, is an example</p></li></ul></li></ul></div></div></div>
