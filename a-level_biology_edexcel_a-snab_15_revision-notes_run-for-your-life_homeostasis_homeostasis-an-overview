the original stimulus produces a response that causes the factor to <b>deviate even more</b> from the normal range</p><ul><li><p>They <b>enhance </b>the effect of the original stimulus</p></li></ul></li><li><p>An example of this is the <b>dilation of the cervix</b> during labour</p><ul><li><p>The cervix stretches as baby pushes against it</p></li><li><p>Stretch receptors in the cervix are stimulated and send impulses to the brain</p></li><li><p>The pituitary gland is stimulated to release oxytocin which increases the intensity of uterine contractions</p></li><li><p>This pushes the baby further down the birth canal and stretches the cervix even further</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Positive feedback loops are useful to <b>quickly activate</b> a process, e.g. blood clotting to close up a wound</p><ul><li><p>When the body is injured, <b>platelets become activated</b></p></li><li><p>They <b>release chemicals</b> which will <b>activate more platelets</b>, which in turn, will release chemicals that will activate even more platelets etc.</p></li><li><p>This ensures that the <b>wound is quickly closed up</b> by a blood clot before too much blood is lost or too many pathogens enter the bloodstream</p></li><li><p>The body will <b>revert to negative feedback mechanisms</b> once the blood clot has formed</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Positive feedback may also kick in when <b>homeostatic mechanisms break down</b></p><ul><li><p>E.g. during prolonged exposure to extreme cold hypothermia can occur; body temperature drops, resulting in decreased metabolism which in turn causes body temperature to drop further</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Since these mechanisms do not maintain a constant internal environment, they are <b>not involved in
